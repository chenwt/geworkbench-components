<h2>MINDY</h2> 
    <p>The MINDY algorithm uses gene expression data  to quantify modulation effects on the regulatory activity of a transcription factor gene (TF) of interest over a set of target genes.  The general workflow includes 1) selection of modulator, hub TF and target genes and 2) defining (result) marker sets in the Table and List panel and displaying results for a single modulator and its target transcription factor(s) in the Heat Map panel. This help topic describes executing <a href="#_Run_MINDY">MINDY analysis</a> and <a href="#_View_MINDY_Results">viewing the results.</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Setting the Main Parameters</h3>
    <h3><img src="mindy_files/T_Mindy_Main.png" width="1110" height="353"></h3> 
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><strong>Modulators List</strong> - (From File or From Set) - The list of candidate modulators can either be loaded from a file as a comma separated list, or  a set of markers from the Markers component can be selected.</p>
    <p><strong>Hub Marker</strong> - Select as the Hub Marker a transcription factor gene. The Hub marker can be entered directly in the text field, or the most recently selected marker in the Markers component will be used. Note that even if you directly type in a marker name, it will be replaced if any selection is made in the Markers component, either in the list or in the set &quot;Selection&quot;. </p>
    <p><strong>Target List</strong> - (All Markers, From File or From Set) - The target list should be composed of genes thought to be regulated by the Hub Marker transcription factor. The list of target markers can be loaded from a file containing a comma separated list, or a set of markers from the Markers component can be selected. Alternatively, All Markers can be selected. </p>
    <p>(Note - the &quot;<strong>All Markers</strong>&quot; checkbox at the bottom of the Analysis component should <strong>not</strong> be used in the MINDY component). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Setting the Advanced Parameters </h3>
    <p><img src="mindy_files/T_Mindy_Advanced.png" width="744" height="324"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sample per Condition (%)</strong> - MINDY calculated the difference in mutual information for the TF-Target interaction between the set where the modulator gene is most expressed  (+) and the set where the modulator gene is least expressed (-). This parameter specifies the percentage of the available samples to include in each group. E.g. 35% means that the top and bottom 35% of a list of samples ranked by expression would be used. </p>
    <p><strong>Conditional (MINDY) </strong>- measures the mutual information (MI) of the TF and its target gene across the subset of samples in which the modulator gene is most (or least) expressed.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Mutual Info</strong>- Threshold for a conditional mutual information (MI) estimate to be considered statistically different from zero. For example, a value of 0.20 filters out target genes with a conditional MI score of less than 0.20. By default, no threshold is set (MI = 0).</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>P-Value</strong> - Significance level for a conditional mutual information (MI) estimate to be considered statistically different from zero. This is a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating no threshold. By default, the value is 1. <strong>(Note - P-values are not currently available in MINDY, so this option is disabled).</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>	Correction</strong> - None or Bonferroni - correct for multiple testing. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Unconditional (ARACNE)</strong>- measures the MI of the TF and its target gene across all samples. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <strong>Mutual Info </strong>- Threshold for an unconditional mutual information (MI) estimate to be considered statistically different from zero. For example, a value of 0.20 filters out target genes with an unconditional MI score of less than 0.20. By default, no threshold is set  (MI = 0).</p>
      <p><strong>P-value</strong> - Significance level for an unconditional mutual information (MI) estimate to be considered statistically different from zero. This is a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating no threshold. By default, the value is 1.</p>
      <p><strong>Correction</strong> - None or Bonferroni  - correct for multiple testing. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>DPI Tolerance</strong> - The Data Processing Inequality can be used to remove the effects of indirect interactions, e.g. if TF1-&gt;TF2-&gt;Target, DPI can be used to remove the indirect action of TF1 on the target. The DPI tolerance specifies the degree of sampling error to be accepted, as with a finite sample size an exact value can not be calculated.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The DPI tolerance is normally between 0 and 0.15 since values larger than 0.15 yields higher false positives.</p>
      </blockquote>
</blockquote>
    <p>See Margolin et al. 2006 for further details on use of DPI. </p>
    <p><strong>DPI Target List</strong> - The DPI target list can be used to limit the ARACNE calculation to transcriptional networks. It is used to screen out spurious regulatory interaction signals of genes that are tightly coexpressed but are not in a regulatory relationship to each other, for example genes for two proteins that are in a physical complex and hence always produced in the same amounts. A comma-separated list can be typed in, or it can be loaded from an external file. If used , the DPI Target List should contain all markers that are annotated as transcription factors. Signalling proteins could also be included. </p>

    <h3>Running a MINDY Analysis </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Select a microarray set node in the Project Folder. </p>
    <p>2. In the analysis pane (lower right of the application), select<b> MINDY Analysis</b>. </p> 
    <p>3. In the Main tab, populate the <b> Modulators List</b> by selecting a set of markers defined in the Markers component, or load a list from a file. </p>
    <p>4. Populate the <b>Target List</b> textbox by selecting the choice &quot;All Markers&quot;, or by selecting a set of markers defined in the Markers component, or by loading a list from a file. </p>
    <p>5. Populate the <b>Hub Gene</b> textbox to designate the TF gene by (1) typing the marker name (as displayed in the Markers component) or (2) in the Selection Area (lower left of the application) Marker Tab, click on the marker name corresponding to the TF.</p>
    <p>6. In the Advanced Tab, accept the default values or update the parameter values by clicking the parameter textbox and typing a new value.</p> 
    <p>7. Click <b>Analyze</b>. If successful, the project window is updated to reflect the MINDY result node which is a child node of the input dataset. Please note that the Dataset History tab captures the analysis parameters. </p>
