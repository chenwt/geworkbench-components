 <h3>Filters</h3> 
    <p>The Filters pane is located in the <b>Command and Analysis Area </b>(see image below) in the lower right of the application. The application offers a selection of pluggable filters to assist in the manipulation of the data and in their preparation for analysis. </p> 
    <p>Filters are used in order to remove data points from an expression dataset, e.g. because some quality data criterion is not met. The result of applying a filter is (1) either to set the status of a value to &quot;missing&quot; or, (2) to completely eliminate a marker from the dataset. In the later case, all measurements for that marker (across all microarrays in the microarray set being filtered) will be eliminated. </p> 
    <p>Changes resulting from the application of a filter are performed directly on the selected dataset (i.e., a separate copy of the dataset is not generated). Available filters are displayed in the Filtering Panel (figure below). Experienced users can add or remove filters by manipulating the relative entries in the application configuration file (see the design documentation). Most filters have associated parameters that control their operation. Values for these must be provided in the appropriate areas within the Filtering Panel. </p>
