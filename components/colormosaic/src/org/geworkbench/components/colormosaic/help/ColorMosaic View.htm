    <h3>Color Mosaic View</h3> 
    <p>The Color Mosaic View is located in the<b> View Area </b>(<a href="#_Navigating_a_Color-mosaic_View"> see figure below</a>)<b> </b>in the top right of the application. This is a utility to view Eisen plot views of a Microarray dataset. Measurements in the selected microarray dataset are displayed as a two-dimensional matrix with microarrays as columns and genes/markers as rows. A blue-red color spectrum is used to indicate the relative magnitudes of the measurements. Red represents over-expressed values while blue represents under-expressed ones. The relative colors are obtained for each probe (or spot) independent of the other probes in the dataset. Over- (and under-) expression is represented by relative values of expression of a probe across all micro-arrays in a dataset. White indicates mean values of expression. </p> 
    <h3>To view a dataset using Color-mosaic View</h3> 
    <p>&#12290; Select a dataset in the Project Panel and then select the Color Mosaic option in the <b>View Area </b>at the top-right section of the interface. </p> 
    <h3><a name="_Navigating_a_Color-mosaic_View"></a>Navigating a Color-mosaic View</h3> 
    <p>&#12290; <u>Clicking on mosaic</u>: Clicking on any of the spots in the mosaic highlights the marker clicked in the Marker Panel.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; <u>Image Snapshot:</u> Right clicking on the mosaic will bring up the option to capture an image snapshot of the color mosaic. </p> 
    <p>The steps of basic usage are indicated with numbers in the below screenshot. </p> 
    <p>1. <u>Printer Icon</u>: Prints the displayed image.</p> 
    <p>2. <u>Overlapping Pages Icon</u>: Copies the selected image. </p> 
    <p>3. <u>Pat</u>: Display motifs created e.g. in the Association Panel. Elements of the motif will be framed in yellow on the mosaic grid.</p> 
    <p>4. <u>Abs</u>: Absolute Value - Not used in this version.</p> 
    <p>5. <u>All</u>: Must be toggled on to display data, but not otherwise used in this version.</p> 
    <p>6. <u>Ratio</u>: Not used in this version.</p> 
    <p>7. <u>Acce(ssion)</u>: Displays marker accession numbers to the right of the mosaic view.</p> 
    <p>8. <u>Label</u>: Displays marker annotations to the right of the mosaic.</p> 
    <p>9. <u>'All Arrays' and 'All Markers'</u>: When not selected, subsets of the markers and microarrays which have been activated are displayed. The selections are created from the activated Marker and Phenotype Panels. When selected, all markers and/or all arrays will be displayed.</p> 
    <p>10. <u>Intensity slider</u>: Widget enables user to change the color intensity of the mosaic display. The color of the displayed markers changes linearly with slider movement.</p> 
    <p>11. <u>Gene Height</u>: Widget lets user change the height of each marker/gene row to a required number of pixels.</p> 
    <p>12. <u>Gene Width</u>: Widget lets user to change the width of each column in the mosaic to a required number of pixels.</p>
