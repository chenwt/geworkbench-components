<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>
The Scatter Plot component allows the visual comparison of the expression data for pairs of microarrays or markers.
Expression data is plotted with one marker or microarray on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Up to 6 plots can
be viewed at once. Each plot has the same marker/microarray on the x-axis. Consider the the following screenshot:
</p>
<p><img src="images/screenShot1.png"></p>
<p>
Here there are two marker plots. The marker <code>AFFX-BioC-5_at</code> is on the x-axis while the markers
<code>AFFX-BioB-5_at</code> and <code>AFFX-BioC-3_at</code> are on the y-axes.
</p>
<h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<p>
The steps of basic usage are indicated with numbers in the below screenshot.
<ol>
 <li>This tab switches between Marker/Marker and Array/Array plots. Switching between these tabs does not affect the
 charts in the other tab.</li>
 <li>Markers or arrays can be searched interactively using this control.</li>
 <li>The first marker or array selected is placed on the x-axis and his highlighted in black. A different marker or
 array can be placed on the x-axis by right-clicking the marker/array name and choosing <i>Put on X-Axis</i>.</li>
 <li>Subsequent selections of markers or arrays after a marker/array is on the x-axis results in the creation of a
 chart. Plotted markers/arrays are highlighted in grey. Clicking again on one of these markers/arrays results in the
 plot being removed.</li>
 <li>Clicking the <i>Rank Statistics Plot</i> checkbox transforms the data for analysis. The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
 values are sorted and plotted according to their rank.</li>
 <li>By default, a black reference line with slope 1 is displayed in each chart. This may be turned off with the
 <i>Reference Line</i> checkbox. Also, the slope of the line may be adjusted in the <i>Slope</i> textbox.</li>
 <li>The <i>Clear Charts</i> button removes all charts and removes the x-axis selection.
 The <i>Print</i> button prints the charts after allowing the user to adjust the page setup and choose a printer.
 The <i>Image Snapshot</i> button captures the charts as an image and places it in to the project underneath the
 current data set.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>
Each chart can be manipulated by right-clicking anywhere in the plot area.
This brings up a menu that allows the chart to be invidually saved as an image or printed, zoomed and visual properties
adjusted.

<h4>Panel Selections</h4>
<p>
Markers or microarrays that are members of active panels will be plotted with unique visual properties.
These panel selections are managed for arrays and markers in the Phenotype Panel and the Gene Panel, respectively.
Consider an example where the two panels are activated in the Phenotype Panel:
</p>
<p><img src="images/selections1.png"></p>
<p>
Two phenotypic panels <i>BL</i> and <i>FL</i> are activated in the Phenotype Panel. This results in the arrays in
these panels to take on different visual properties in the charts:
</p>
<p><img src="images/screenShot3.png"></p>
<p>
Unchecking the <i>All Arrays</i> checkbox (indicated above with a <b>1</b>) will remove all arrays from the charts except
those that are in activated panels. So, in the above screenshot, all the red squares would be removed from the chart.
Corresponding behavior can be achieved with marker plots, the Gene Panel and the <i>All Markers</i> checkbox.
</p>
<p>
The visual properties of a panel may be adjusted. From within the Phenotype or Gene Panel, right-click a panel and
choose <i>Change Visual Properties</i>.
</p>
<p><img src="images/visualProperties1.png"></p>
<p>
A dialog opens that allows the shape and color to be changed for that panel.
These properties are honored in the Scatter Plot as well as other caWorkbench components.
