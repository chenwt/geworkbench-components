    <h3> Alignment Results </h3>  
    <p>The Alignment Result component is located in the<b> View Area</b> in the upper right of the application. This visualization component displays blast results from the<b> Analysis Area</b> Sequence Alignment component. The results of a blast search is displayed both as Paracel BLAST in a separate window and BLAST alignments in the Alignment Result component. They include the BLAST hit data with hyperlinks to NCBI data pages that describe the sequence . From this component a user can display the alignments in the panel and <a href="#_Adding_Sequences_to_a Project">create a fasta file with sequences selected. </a></p> 
    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p>The steps of basic usage are indicated in the below screenshot.</p> 
    <p><img border="0" width="553" height="327" src="alignment_files/image001.jpg"></p> 
    <p>1 Ancillary data node created for Blast results.</p> 
    <p>2 Click on the sequence to display the alignments in the below display panel. This includes hyperlinks to NCBI public databases pages describe the selected sequence. </p> 
    <p>3 Select <b>Add Selected Sequences to Project</b> to create a dataset of the selected sequences.</p> 
    <p>4 Loads stored html alignment file. </p> 
    <p>5 Clears the selected sequences. </p> 
    <p>6 Selects all sequences.</p> 
    <p>7 Select sequences and the click on <b>Only Added Alignment Parts</b>. This creates a FASTA file that contains portions of the sequence that align with the input data. </p> 
    <p>Note: Access the Sequence Panel component to view the sequence shown as lines.</p> 
    <h3><a name="_Adding_Sequences_to_a Project"></a>Adding Sequences to a Project</h3> 
    <p>1 Click on the<b> Include </b>checkboxes to selected sequences of those hits. Click on <b>Select All </b>to select all of hits.</p> 
    <p>2 Click on <b>Add Selected to a Project.</b> The program will generate a temporary FASTA file for those sequences; a new file node will be added under current project.</p> 
    <p>3 (If desired) Right click on the file node to save or rename.</p>
