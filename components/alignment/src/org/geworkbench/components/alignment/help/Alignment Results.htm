<h3>Alignment Results </h3> 
 <p>The Alignment Result component is located in the<b> View Area</b> in the upper right of the application. This visualization component displays Blast results from the<b> Analysis Area</b> Sequence Alignment component. When Blast results are returned, they are placed in the Project Folders as a child node of the sequence they correspond to. Scroll over the data node created and the tooltip will indicate the number of sequences in the file.</p> 
    <p>The results of a Blast search is displayed both as Paracel BLAST in a separate window and BLAST alignments in the Alignment Result component. This help section describes Alignment Results and how to <a href="#_Adding_Sequences_to_a Project">create a fasta file with sequences selected. </a></p> 
     <h3><img border="0" src="alignment_files/image001.gif"></h3> 
    <p>The alignment results are divided into the following five areas: </p> 
    <p>1. The list of markers included in the Blast results. Select a marker from this panel to the right (2) is updated. The Search box and Find Next are used to locate markers within this list.</p> 
    <p>2. This lists the Blast hits for the selected maker. This information is also displayed in a separate Web Browser (see Blast Advanced Options).</p> 
    <p>3. The selected sequence details are displayed in this section of the alignment results. Select sequences of interest to add back to the main project by checking the include checkbox or Select All button. This includes hyperlinks to NCBI public databases sequence description. </p> 
    <p>4. This section includes the following buttons: </p>

    <p><b>Reset:</b> Clears the selected sequences. </p> 
    <p><b>Selects all:</b> This is used to select all checkboxes to include all of the sequences for  the selected Marke.</p> 
    <p><b>Add Selected Sequences to Project:</b> A FASTA file is created with the included sequences selected after this button is selected. Scroll over the data node created and the tooltip will indicate the number of sequences in the file.</p> 
    <p><b>Only Added Alignment Parts</b>. Select sequences and the click on <b>Only Added Alignment Parts</b> to create a FASTA file that contains portions of the sequence that aligns with the input data. Scroll over the data node created and the tooltip will indicate the number of sequences in the file.</p>
