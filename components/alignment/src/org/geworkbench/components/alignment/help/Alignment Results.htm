<h3>Alignment Results </h3> 
    <p>The Alignment Result component is located in the<b> View Area</b> in the upper right of the application. This visualization component displays blast results from the<b> Analysis Area</b> Sequence Alignment component. When Blast results are returned they are placed in the Project Folders as a child of the sequence they correspond to. You can mouse over the result set to see how many sequences are in it. </p>

    <p>The results of a blast search is displayed both as Paracel BLAST in a separate window and BLAST alignments in the Alignment Result component. They include the BLAST hit data with hyperlinks to NCBI data pages that describe the sequence. From this component a user can display the alignments in the panel and <a href="#_Adding_Sequences_to_a_Project">create a fasta file with sequences selected. </a></p>

    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p><b>Include</b>: Select sequences to add back to the main project by checking the include box. Select the sequence to display the alignments in the below display panel. This includes hyperlinks to NCBI public databases pages describe the selected sequence. </p> 
    <p><b>Load</b>: Loads stored html alignment file. </p> 
    <p><b>Reset:</b> Clears the selected sequences. </p> 
    <p><b>Selects all:</b> All of the sequences.</p> 
    <p><b>Only Added Alignment Parts</b>. Select sequences and the click on <b>Only Added Alignment Parts</b> to create a FASTA file that contains portions of the sequence that aligns with the input data. </p> 
    <p><b>Search:</b><b></b></p> 
    <h3><a name="_Adding_Sequences_to_a_Project"></a>Adding Sequences to a Project</h3> 
    <p>1 Click on the<b> Include </b>checkboxes to selected sequences of those hits. Click on <b>Select All </b>to select all of hits.</p> 
    <p>2 Click on <b>Add Selected to a Project.</b> The program will generate a temporary FASTA file for those sequences; a new file node will be added under current project.</p> 
    <p>3 (If desired) Right click on the file node to save or rename.</p>
