  <h3>Dot Matrix Panel </h3> 
    <p>The Dot Matrix is located in the <b>View Area</b> in the upper right of the application. This is a visualization comparison of two genomic regions with detailed annotation for both regions.</p> 
    <h3><img width="844" height="480" src="DotMatrixPanel_files/image001.jpg"></h3> 
    <p><b>Basic Usage </b></p> 
    <p><b>Tool Bar: </b>This is a series of radio buttons that modify the display of the Dot Matrix.</p> 
    <p>&#8211; <b>Direct On/Off and Invert On/Off - </b>Hides or displays results of direct to direct or direct to complementary comparisons. </p> 
    <p>&#8211; <b>Annotation X On/Off and Annotation Y On/Off - </b>Hides or displays annotation for sequences along X or Y axis. </p> 
    <p>&#8211; <b>Save Image - </b>Stores the current picture in jpeg format.</p> 
    <p><b>Info Bar:</b> Located below the Tool Bar, this section of the Dot Matrix provides chromosome mouse over information.</p> 
    <p>&#8211;The top row in the Info Bar section provides current mouse position information. If the mouse is in the Dot Matrix Area absolute and relative sequence position will be displayed. If the mouse pointed at Annotation Feature the name, position and Annotation Track name will be displayed. </p> 
    <p>&#8211; The bottom row in the Info Bar section provides the title of the currently displayed comparison including chromosome number and segment positions.</p> 
    <p><b>Annotation Area</b></p> 
    <p>&#8211; Annotation Area consists of separate Annotation Tracks and each track consists of Annotation Features. Most of displayed data obtained from UCSC server (golden Path, <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu</a> ) some other tracks were computed by server side part of Synteny Component. Currently only PFP track (Paracel Filtering Package, Paracel inc.) for identifying repeats and low complexity regions is computed by server side application. Use Annotation subtab in the Synteny tab in Analysis area to change hide/display annotation tracks.</p> 
    <p>&#8211; Mouse over an Annotation Feature to display its name, position and Annotation Track name. If the feature has a related URL, the user can click on the feature to view that url in a new browser.</p>
