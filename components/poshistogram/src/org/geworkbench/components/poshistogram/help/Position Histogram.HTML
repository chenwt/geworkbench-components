  <h3>Position Histogram </h3> 
    <p>The Position Histogram is located in the View Area in the upper right of the application. This component displays results from the Sequence Discovery Panel in the <b>Analysis Area</b> in the lower-right of the application. This plots the positions of SPLASH motifs as a Position Histograms. </p>

    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p>The steps of basic usage are indicated in the above screenshot.</p> 
    <p>A. Click Plot. Note: The motifs are displayed in the Sequence Panel as they are selected. Each motif is represented by a specific color which is the same in both panels.</p> 
    <p>B. Stores the graph created as a jpeg file.</p> 
    <p>C. Applies the filters of <b>Avg/Peak </b>and<b> Abs/Rel.</b></p> 
    <p>D. Displays the fraction or absolute of total number of hits in the y axis. To apply, click<b> Avg/Rel., Filter </b>and<b> Plot. </b></p> 
    <p>E. Alters step size to the sum of the p-value at every occurrence of the hit. To apply, click<b> Abs/Peak, Filter </b>and<b> Plot.</b></p> 
    <p>F. This has not been implemented</p> 
    <p>G. This has not been implemented</p> 
    <p>H. The step is the average of the motif histogram across positions. The lower the step size the more fine-grained motif is displayed.</p> 
    <p>I. This is the display area of the graph which is stored when the graph is saved.</p> 
    <p>J. The y axis is the number of sequence hits for that pattern.</p> 
    <p>K. The x axis is the position on the sequence at which the hit occurs.</p> 
    <p>L. The legend for the sequences that is included in the position histogram.</p>ow by right clicking on the element and using the pop-up menus or using the Edit menu from the main menu bar.</p>
