  <h3>Position Histogram </h3> 
    <p>The Position Histogram is located in the View Area in the upper right of the application. This component displays results from the <a href=" \geworkbench\components\alignment\src\org\geworkbench\components\alignment\help\BlastOverview.htm">Sequence Discovery Panel </a>. This plots the positions of SPLASH motifs as a Position Histograms. </p> 
    <p><img width="909" height="625" src="Position%20Histogram_files/image001.gif"></p> 
    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p>The following summarizes the description and use of each option.</p> 
    <p><b>A. Plot Position: </b>Displays the motifs in the Sequence Panel as they are selected in Pattern Discovery hit results. Each motif is represented by a specific color which is the same in both panels.</p> 
    <p><b>B. Save Graph: </b>Stores the graph as a jpeg file.</p> 
    <p><b>C. Filter: </b>Applies the filters of <b>Avg/Peak </b>and<b> Abs/Rel.</b></p> 
    <p><b>D. ABS/Rel: </b>Displays the fraction or absolute of total number of hits in the y axis. To apply, click<b> Avg/Rel., Filter </b>and<b> Plot. </b></p> 
    <p><b>E. ABS/Peak: </b>Alters step size to the sum of the p-value at every occurrence of the hit. To apply, click<b> Abs/Peak, Filter </b>and<b> Plot.</b></p> 
    <p><b>F. Pairs and flex thr: </b>These are not implemented.</p> 
    <p><b>H. Step: </b>This is the average of the motif histogram across positions. The lower the step size the more fine-grained motif is displayed.</p> 
    <p><b>I. Display: </b>Displays the graph which is stored when the graph is saved.</p> 
    <p><b>J. Support: </b>The y axis is the number of sequence hits for that pattern.</p> 
    <p><b>K. Position: </b>The x axis is the position on the sequence at which the hit occurs.</p> 
    <p><b>L. Legend: </b>The legend for the sequences included in the position histogram.</p>
