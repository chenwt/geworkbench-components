  <h3>Position Histogram </h3> 
    <p>The Position Histogram is located in the View Area in the upper right of the application. This component displays results from the Sequence Discovery Panel in the <b>Analysis Area</b> in the lower-right of the application. This plots the positions of SPLASH motifs as a Position Histograms. </p>

    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p>The steps of basic usage are indicated in the above screenshot.</p> 
    <b><p>A. Plot Position:  </b> Displays the motifs in the Sequence Panel as they are selected. Each motif is represented by a specific color which is the same in both panels.</p> 
    <b><p>B. Save Graph:  </b>  Stores the graph created as a jpeg file.</p> 
     <b><p>C. Filter:  </b> Applies the filters of <b>Avg/Peak </b>and<b> Abs/Rel.</b></p> 
     <b><p>D. ABS/Rel: </b> Displays the fraction or absolute of total number of hits in the y axis. To apply, click<b> Avg/Rel., Filter </b>and<b> Plot. </b></p> 
    <b><p>E. ABS/Peak: </b> Alters step size to the sum of the p-value at every occurrence of the hit. To apply, click<b> Abs/Peak, Filter </b>and<b> Plot.</b></p> 
    <p>F. This has not been implemented</p> 
    <p>G. This has not been implemented</p> 
    <b><p>H. Step: </b> The step is the average of the motif histogram across positions. The lower the step size the more fine-grained motif is displayed.</p> 
    <b><p>I.  Display: </b> This is the display area of the graph which is stored when the graph is saved.</p> 
    <b><p>J. Support: </b> The y axis is the number of sequence hits for that pattern.</p> 
    <b><p>K. Position: </b> The x axis is the position on the sequence at which the hit occurs.</p> 
    <b><p>L. Legend: </b> The legend for the sequences that is included in the position histogram.</p>
