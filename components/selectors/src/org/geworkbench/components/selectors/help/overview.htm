<h3>Panel Overview </h3> 
    <p>The Phenotype and Gene Panels are located in the Selection Area (see figure below) in the lower left of the application. Panels are collections of either gene markers (gene marker panel) or microarrays (phenotype). Panels provide a convenient mechanism for grouping together markers and microarrays of interest according to the user&#8217;s preferences. They are used to dissect the potentially massive expression data into more manageable chunks. </p> 
    <p>Gene marker panels and phenotypes are displayed separately (in the &quot;Marker Panel&quot; and &quot;Phenotype Panel&quot; areas respectively). Panels can be grouped into panel sets based on shared features. Panel set names, panel names and their components are displayed in a tree structure.</p> 
    <p>The following operations are supported for panels:</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Create panel set &amp; panel</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Save/Load panel set</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Rename panel set and panel</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Delete panel set and panel</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Activate/Deactivate panel</p>
