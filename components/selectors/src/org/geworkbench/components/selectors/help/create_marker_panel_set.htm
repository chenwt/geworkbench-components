 <h3>Creating a Group </h3> 
    <p>Both Marker and Phenotype tabs have two sections in the GUI: the upper frame lists the full data set, and the lower frame lists any user-defined groupings. The application supports grouping Markers and Arrays/Phenotypes to facilitate data management. These grouping are referred to as Marker Sets and Phenotype sets. </p>

    <p><b>Basic Usage</b></p> 
    <p><b>Upper frame:</b> When a data file is opened from a Project Folder, the chip or gene list is displayed in the upper frame. </p> 
    <p><b>Lower frame: </b>Items are selected from the upper frame and grouped in the lower frame&#8212;according to the user&#8217;s preferences&#8212;into groups and sets. In the screens above, the lower frame of the Marker tab contains the heading <b>Marker Sets</b>. Below the <b>Phenotype Groups</b> heading is a drop down menu displaying the Marker Set name. The set names are chosen by the investigator. Within each set, comprising a designated phenotype, chips are further grouped into sub-phenotypes groups. The upper frame displays only a partial list of the chips in the microarray file. The full Chip List can be seen using the scroll bar at the right. </p> 
    <p><b>New:</b> Click on New to create a Group. The drop down group list is updated to reflect the addition of the group. To add Panel Sets to a group refer to Create Panel Set online help. </p>
