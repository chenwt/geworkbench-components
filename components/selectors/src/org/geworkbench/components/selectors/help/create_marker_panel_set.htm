<p>Create a Panel Group </p> 
    <p>Both Gene and Phenotype panels have two portions in GUI: the upper frame lists the full data set, and the lower frame lists any user-defined groupings. The application supports grouping the list items into Panels Groups to facilitate data management. The Panel Groups are further defined into Panel Sets. </p> 
    <p><b>Basic Usage</b></p> <b> </b> 
    <p><b>Upper frame</b>: When a data file is opened from a Project Folder, the chip or gene list is displayed in the upper frame. </p> 
    <p><b>Lower frame: </b>Items are selected from the upper panel and grouped&#8212;according to the user&#8217;s preferences&#8212;into panels groups and panel sets. In the image below, the lower frame of the Phenotype Panel contains the heading <b>Phenotype Groups</b>. Below the <b>Phenotype Groups</b> heading is a drop down menu displaying the Panel Set Labels. The Panel Set Labels are chosen by the investigator. Within each set, comprising a designated phenotype, chips are further grouped into sub-phenotypes groups. The Panel View (upper frame) displays only a partial list of the chips in the microarray file. The full Chip List can be seen using the scroll bar at the right. </p> 
    <p><b>New:</b> Click on New to create a Panel Group. The drop down group list is updated to reflect the addition of the group. To add Panel Sets to a group refer to Create Panel Set help </p>
