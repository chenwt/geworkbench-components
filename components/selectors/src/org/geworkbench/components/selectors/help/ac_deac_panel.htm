When such a view takes effect, the component will only display a subset of the original data that contains those markers (microarrays)that are contained in activated marker panels (phenotypes).</p>An activated panel is available to other caWorkbench components. Unless it is activated, a panel will not be taken into consideration by other components. More than one panel can be active at the same time.
