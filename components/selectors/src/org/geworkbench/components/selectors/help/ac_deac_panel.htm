    <h3>Activate a Panel Set</h3> 
    <p>Activated panel sets affect the contents displayed in the various visualization components. Most such components provide an option for imposing a <i>panel-view.</i> When such a view takes effect, the component will only display a subset of the original data that contains those markers (microarrays) that are contained in activated marker panels (phenotypes). An activated panel is available to other caWorkbench components. Unless it is activated, a panel will not be taken into consideration by other components. More than one panel can be active at the same time. Perform the following steps to activate a panel:</p> 
    <p>- Click on the panel and then perform one of the following actions: </p> 
    <p>&#12290; Right-click on the panel and select <b>Activate</b></p> 
    <p>&#12290; Select the checkbox next to the panel name.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Through the main menu&gt; Commands Panel &gt; <b>Activate Panel.</b></p>
