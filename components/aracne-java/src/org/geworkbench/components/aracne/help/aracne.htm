<a name="ARACNe"></a><h1>ARACNe</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular
Networks) is an information-theoretic algorithm used to identify
transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray
expression profile data. The resulting network is displayed using the
Cytoscape component. ARACNe can be used to predict potential functional
associations among genes, or to predict novel functions for
uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between
genes. The results take the form of a matrix of candidate interactions,
also called an adjacency matrix, which can be used for further network
visualization and analysis. </p><p>ARACNe can perform two separate calculations:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Mutual Information</b>: The mutual information (MI) of one or more marker's expression profile(s) is calculated against all other active markers.
</li><li> <b>Data Processing Inequality (DPI)</b>: The DPI calculation
(triangle inequality) is used to remove the weakest interaction (edge)
between any three markers. That is, if a MI value is available between
each of three possible pairings of three markers, the weakest
interaction of the three will be removed from the output. This has the
intent of removing indirect interactions. For example, if
A-&gt;B-&gt;C, the interaction A-&gt;C will likely be weaker than
A-&gt;B or B-&gt;C and would be removed. A tolerance can be set which
relaxes this screening to account for uncertainty in the MI
calculation.
</li></ol>
<p>Parameters described below allow one to incorporate a list of
putative transcription factors and optimize the run to discover targets
that they may regulate.
</p>
<a name="Run_ARACNe"></a><h2>Run ARACNe</h2>
<ol><li> Load or select a microarray data set, or select an existing adjacency matrix in the project folders area of geWorkbench.
</li><li> In the analysis pane (lower right), select ARACNE analysis from the analysis list.
</li><li> Populate the  parameters used for this analysis method  (see below for details).
</li><li> Click on <b>Analyze</b>. If successful, the resulting
adjacency matrix is added to the Project Folders component as a child
of its parent dataset. The Dataset history captures the analysis
parameters. The network will be depicted visually in the Cytoscape
component.
</li></ol>
<p>Quick Example:
</p>
<ul><li> Load the tutorial dataset Bcell-100.exp.
</li><li> Note - the parameter files calculated in the preprocessing
step (see below) for this dataset are included with geWorkbench and
will be used as needed by default.
</li><li> Select the hub gene option "List" (version 1.6.3) or "From Sets" (version 1.7.0) and enter probe 1973_s_at.
</li><li> Other parameters left at default settings.
</li><li> Click "Analyze".
</li></ul>
<a name="New_Parameters_in_geWorkbench_1.7.0"></a><h2>New Parameters in geWorkbench 1.7.0</h2>
<p>geWorkbench 1.7.0 includes a new release of ARACNe, referred to as ARANCe2.  ARACNe2 includes two important new parameters, <b>Algorithm</b> and <b>Mode</b>.  
</p>
<a name="Algorithm"></a><h3> Algorithm</h3>
<p>Two algorithms are now offered, Adaptive Partitioning and Fixed Bandwidth.  
</p>
<a name="Adaptive_Partitioning"></a><h4>Adaptive Partitioning</h4>
<p>Adaptive Partitioning was added with the incorporation of the ARACNe2 code into geWorkbench in version 1.7.0.   <b>Adaptive
Partitioning is much faster than the Fixed Bandwidth method, and is
also considered to produce superior results. Adaptive Partitioning is
now the recommended algorithm for all purposes.</b>  Unlike the Fixed Bandwidth method, it does not used a fixed kernel-width when calculating the MI.
</p>
<a name="Fixed_Bandwidth"></a><h4>Fixed Bandwidth</h4>
<p>Fixed Bandwidth was the only algorithm offered with geWorkbench
1.6.3 and earlier and is included for compatibility with previous
versions. This method uses a kernel-width parameter for a Gaussian
function used to calculate the MI.
</p>
<a name="Mode"></a><h3>Mode</h3>
<a name="Preprocessing"></a><h4>Preprocessing</h4> 
<p>In this mode, runtime parameters are calculated, but no MI
calculation is performed. Preprocessing for a given combination of
dataset and algorithm need be run only once. The results are written to
one or two files in the geWorkbench root directory. The names used for
these files incorporate both the name of the dataset and the name of
the algorithm, and thus are specific to the particular combination.
Each time ARACNe is run in Discovery mode, it will look for the
dataset-specific parameter files in its root directory. If the files
are not found (Preprocessing has not been run), default parameter
values will be used.
</p>
<ul><li> Fixed Bandwidth (FBW) algorithm - two files are written to the
geWorkbench root directory, one containing parameters for calculating
the kernel width, and the other containing parameters for calculating a
MI threshold from a specified P-value.
</li><li> Adaptive Partitioning (AP) algorithm - only the parameter
file for calculating a MI threshold from a specified P-value is
written. No kernel-width parameter is used.
</li></ul>
<a name="Preprocessing_files_included_with_geWorkbench"></a><h4>Preprocessing files included with geWorkbench</h4>
<p>Preprocessing as described above was run on the Bcell-100.exp
dataset included with geWorkbench. The resulting ARACNe parameter files
are also included in the geWorkbench root directory. They will be used
by default when the Bcell-100.exp dataset is used in tutorials. Note
that if you rerun the preprocessing step, the relevant file(s) will be
overwritten.
</p><p>The parameter files included in geWorkbench are:
</p>
<ul><li> Bcell-100.exp_ARACNe_AP_threshold.txt - Adaptive Partitioning, Pvalue-to-MI threshold conversion parameters.
</li><li> Bcell-100.exp_ARACNe_FBW_kernel.txt   - Fixed Bandwidth, kernel width calculation parameters.
</li><li> Bcell-100.exp_ARACNe_FBW_threshold.txt - Fixed Bandwidth, Pvalue-to-MI threshold conversion parameters.
</li></ul>
<a name="Discovery"></a><h4>Discovery</h4>
<p>The ARACNe mutual information and the DPI (if selected) calculations
are run. If dataset-specific parameter files are present, they will be
used as needed (based on settings selected for Kernel Width and
Threshold).
</p>
<a name="Complete"></a><h4>Complete</h4>
<p>A preprocessing run will be performed followed immediately by a
Discovery run. The dataset-specific parameter files created during the
Preprocssing step will be used if needed (based on settings selected
for Kernel Width and Threshold).
</p>
<a name="When_is_preprocessing_not_needed.3F"></a><h4>When is preprocessing not needed?</h4>
<p>The preprocessing step can be time consuming. If you are for example
using Adaptive Partioning, and decide you do not need to specify a
p-value threshold for accepting edges, then you can just set a MI value
as the threshold and proceed directly to Discovery mode. This will
however make interpreting results more difficult.
</p><p>If ARACNe does not find the dataset-specific parameter files it
needs as described above, it will use by default parameters calculated
from the B-cell dataset (see Margolin et al., 2006).

</p><p><a name="Hub_Marker.28s.29"></a>
</p>
<h4>Hub Marker(s)</h4>
<p>Specifies which gene markers will be treated as "hubs" in the ARACNE
mutual information (MI) calculation. The mutual information is
calculated for each specified hub marker against all other markers in
the submitted dataset.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>All vs All</b> - The MI of every pair of markers in the dataset is computed, that is, each is used as a hub.
</li><li> <b>From Sets</b> - allows a set of markers defined in the
Markers component to be chosen from a pulldown menu. Alternatively, the
user can type in the names of desired markers directly as a comma
separated list.
</li><li> <b>From File</b> - allows a comma-separated list of markers to be read in from a file by clicking <b>Load Markers</b>..
</li></ul>
<a name="Algorithm_2"></a><h4>Algorithm</h4> 
<p>Choose the algorithm used to calculate the pairwise mutual information values (see above for further details). 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Adaptive Partitioning</b> (default) - should generally be used for all new calculations.   
</li><li> <b>Fixed Bandwidth</b> - previous, slower algorithm using a fixed Gaussian kernel.  <br>
</li></ul>
<a name="Mode_2"></a><h4>Mode</h4>
<p>Used to control the calculation and use of runtime parameters from the input dataset (see above for further details). 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Preprocessing</b> - calculates the required parameters and writes them to parameter files.
</li><li> <b>Discovery</b> - The ARACNe mutual information calculation is run.  Uses pre-calculated parameter files as needed if they are present.
</li><li> <b>Complete</b> - Preprocessing and Discovery runs are combined into a single step.
</li></ul>
<p><a name="Threshold_Type"></a></p>
<h4>Threshold Type</h4>
<p>This drop-down specifies the type of threshold to be used and can
take the values &ldquo;Mutual Info&rdquo; or &ldquo;P-value&rdquo;. The actual value entered
into the adjacent text area is always a number between 0 and 1.
</p>
<a name="Kernel_width"></a><h4>Kernel width</h4>
<p>The Kernel width is a scaling parameter used for fitting a Gaussian
function to the data when running the FIXED_BANDWIDTH algorithm only,
otherwise this field is disabled. If used, the value can be either
inferred or specified directly.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Inferred</b>: If PREPROCESSING has been run on the dataset
(mode is set to PREPROCESSING or COMPLETE), the kernel width is
calculated directly from those results. If PREPROCESSING has not been
run, the kernel width is inferred based on parameters fitted to a large
B-cell dataset (Margolin et al, 2006), extrapolated for the number of
samples in the dataset being tested.
</li><li> <b>Specify</b>: The user can enter a value for the kernel width directly, e.g. based on a prior calculation with this dataset.
</li></ul>
<a name="DPI_Tolerance"></a><h4>DPI Tolerance</h4>
<p>The Data Processing Inequality (triangle inequality)can be used to
remove the effects of indirect interactions, e.g. if
TF1-&gt;TF2-&gt;Target, DPI can be used to remove the indirect action
of TF1 on the target. Stated another way, the DPI can be used to remove
the weakest interaction of those between any three markers. The DPI
tolerance specifies the degree of sampling error to be accepted, as
with a finite sample size an exact value MI can not be calculated. The
higher the tolerance specified, the fewer the edges that will be
removed.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Do Not Apply</b> - Do not use the DPI. 
</li><li> <b>Apply</b> - DPI is applied using the threshold value
(between 0.0 and 1.0) specified in the adjacent text field. The higher
the threshold, the weaker the screening and the more edges will be
included in the final output.  <br>
</li></ul>
<a name="DPI_Target_List"></a><h4>DPI Target List</h4>
<p>The DPI target list can be used to limit the ARACNE calculation to
transcriptional networks. It is used to screen out spurious regulatory
interaction signals of genes that are tightly co-expressed but are not
in a regulatory relationship to each other, for example genes for two
proteins that are in a physical complex and hence always produced in
the same amounts. A comma-separated list can be typed in, or it can be
loaded from an external file. If used, the DPI Target List should
contain all markers that are annotated as transcription factors.
Signaling proteins could also be included.
</p>
<ul><li> Details: If the box is checked, the user selects and loads a
file which specifies markers (which should be a list of one or more
presumptive transcription factors) which will be given preferential
treatment during the DPI edge-removal step. Edges originating from
markers on this list will not be removed by edges originating from
markers not on this list. However, for DPI calculations where all three
markers are members of the list, the weakest connecting edge may still
be removed.
</li></ul>
<a name="Array_and_Marker_Set_Overrides"></a><h4>Array and Marker Set Overrides</h4>
<ul><li> <b>All Markers</b>: checking this box overrides any activated marker set in the Markers component.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>All Arrays</b>: checking this box overrides any activated array set in the Arrays/Phenotypes component.
</li></ul>
<a name="Bootstrapping"></a><h2>Bootstrapping</h2>
<blockquote>Bootstrap analysis can be used to generate a more reliable
estimate of statistical significance for the interactions. Please see
Margolin et al. 2006, Nature Protocols, Vol 1, No. 2, pg. 663-672 for
further details (full reference below). Briefly, repeated runs of
ARACNE are made, with arrays drawn at random from the full dataset with
replacement. The same number of arrays is drawn each time as is present
in the original dataset. A permutation test is then used to obtain a
null distribution, against which the statistical significance of
support for each network edge connection (interaction) can be measured.
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Bootstrap number</b>: Specifies the number of bootstrapping runs to perform. 
</li><li> <b>Consensus threshold</b> (for bootstrapping only): After
the bootstrapping runs are made, a permutation test is used to estimate
the significance of interactions. The consensus threshold sets the
cutoff point for calling the interactions significant and returning
them in the final adjancency matrix  <br>
</li></ul>
<a name="ARACNe_Example"></a><h2>ARACNe Example</h2>
<p>1. (optional but recommended) - Obtain the latest HG-U95Av2 annotation file from the Affymetrix NetAffx website (<a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx" class="external free" title="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx" rel="nofollow">http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx</a>).  As of this writing, the latest version is "HG_U95Av2.na28.annot.csv".  
</p><p>2. If you have not already done so, go to the Component
Configuration Manager and load the ARACNe analysis. This will also load
the Cytoscape Viewer. </p><p>3. Load the data file Bcell-100.exp as type "Affymetrix File
Matrix". When asked for an annotation file, navigate to and select the
file you obtained above - e.g. "HG_U95Av2.na28.annot.csv".
</p><p>4. In the Marker Sets component, load the file
"70_TFs_from_HG-U95Av2.na28.csv". This file is included in the
geWorkbench tutorial data.
</p><p><img src="aracne_files/T_ARACNE_load_markers.png" width="227" height="376">

</p><p>7. Press the "Analyze" button to launch the job. On a current
generation desktop machine expect this example to run for several
minutes.
</p><p>8. When the calculation is finished, the result is returned as
an "adjacency matrix" - that is, a list of nodes which have
above-threshold MI values - and placed into the Project Folders
component.
</p><p>9. The adjacency matrix will be visualized automatically in the Cytoscape component, as shown below.
</p><p><img src="aracne_files/T_ARACNE_result1.png"  width="861" height="675">
</p><p><br>
There is now 2-way interaction available between Cytoscape and geWorkbench.  
</p>
<ol><li> Nodes selected in Cytoscape appear in the Marker Sets component in the set "Cytoscape selection".  
</li><li> In addition, any set of markers in the Marker Sets component
can be projected onto the Cytoscape display, where they will appear
highlighted.
</li></ol>
<p>This interaction is demonstrated further on the  Online Help page for Cytoscape.
