    <h3>ARACNE</h3> 
    <p>ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) is an information-theoretic algorithm used to identify transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray expression profile data and visualize the analysis results. ARACNE predicts potential functional associations among genes, or novel functions for uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between gene. This help topic describes <a href="#_Run_Aracne">executing ARACNE</a> and <a href="#_View_Arance_Results">viewing the results</a><a name="_Run_Aracne"></a> a matrix of candidate interactions, also called an adjacency matrix, which can be used for further network visualization and analysis.</p> 
    <h3>Run ARACNE </h3> 
    <p>1. Load or select a microarray set or adjacency matrix  in the project folders area of geWorkbench.</p> 
    <p>2. In the analysis pane (lower right), select ARACNE analysis from the analysis list.</p> 
    <p>3. Populate the <a href="#_Parameters">parameters</a> used for this analysis method.</p> 
    <p>4. Select the location to run the analysis (local or Grid) in the service subtab. </p> 
    <p>5. Click on <b>Analyze</b>. If successful, the project window is updated to reflect the result node (a child node of the input dataset).  The Dataset history captures the analysis parameters. </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hub Marker(s)</strong>: Select for which pairs of gene markers to perform the ARACNE mutual information (MI) calculation.
        <ul>
          <li>&quot;All vs All&quot; comparison computes the mutual information for each gene expresion profile against all others,</li>
          <li>&quot;List&quot; compares one or a list of expression profiles (these being called &quot;Hub Markers&quot;)  against all other expression profiles in the datast. Supports manually entering a list of comma separated marker ids (or loading the list from a CSV file by clicking <b>Load</b>).</li>

      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Threshold Type</strong>: This drop-down specifies the type of threshold to be used and can take the values &#8220;Mutual Info&#8221; or &#8220;P-value&#8221;. This value is always a number between 0 and 1.</li>
      <li><strong>Kernel width</strong>: The kernel width used for the computation of the MI values. This can be either inferred by the application (select Inferred) or entered explicitly by the user (select Specify).</li>
      <li><strong>DPI Tolerance</strong>: 
        <ul>
          <li>If the &#8220;Do Not Apply&#8221; option is specified, no DPI is applied. </li>
          <li>If the &#8220;Apply&#8221; option is selected then the DPI is applied and the value (between 0 and 1) in the associated text box is used to determine the stringency level of the DPI application.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>DPI Target List</strong>: You can add a list of known transcription factors here that are not to be eliminated during the DPI step. This allows you to overcome the effects of very tight transcriptional correlation between genes that are not involved in regulation, e.g. they may be involved in producting proteins for a macromolecular complex. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>All Markers</strong>: checking this box overrides any activated set markers in the Markers component for inclusion in the pairwise MI calculations. If a marker set is activated, only the markers in the set will be used. In addition, if NO marker sets are activated, all markers will be used. </li>
      <li><strong>All Arrays</strong>: checking this box overrides any activated set arrays in the Arrays/Phenotypes component for inclusion in the MI calculations. If an array set is activated, only those arrays will be used. In addition, if NO array sets are activated, all arrays will be used. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Bootstrap analysis can be used to generate a more reliable estimate of statistical significance for the interactions. Please see Margolin et al. 2006, Nature Protocols, Vol 1, No. 2, pg. 663-672 for further details (full reference below). Briefly, repeated runs of ARACNE are made, with arrays drawn at random from the full dataset with replacement. The same number of arrays are drawn as are present in the original dataset. A permutation test is then used to obtain a null distribution, against which the statistical significance of support for each network edge connection (interaction) can be measured.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bootstrap number</strong>: Specifies the number of bootstrapping runs to perform. </li>
      <li><strong>Consensus threshold</strong> (for bootstrapping only): After the bootstrapping runs are made, a permutation test is used to estimate the significance of interactions. The consensus threshold sets the cutoff point for calling the interactions significant and returning them in the final adjancency matrix</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="_View_Arance_Results"></a>View Arance</h3>
    <p>ARACNE produces as output an adjacency matrix. This contains the MI score for each pair of expression profiles compared. The Cytoscape component can be used to visualize and further manipulate the inferred connectivity data, included selecting sets of interesting genes and returning them to the Markers component as a new set. A description of Cystoscape is located in the Cytoscape Tutorial and Help.</p>
