<h3>Tabular View</h3>

<p>This is a utility for displaying numeric values in selected Microarray datasets. 

  The Microarrays are displayed as columns and marker/genes as rows. Missing data 

  are color coded for easy viewing. This component can handle gene expression 

  data obtained loaded into the application either is <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx">Affymetrix 

  (MAS 4.0/5.0)</a> or <a href="http://www.axon.com/GN_GenePixSoftware.html">Genepix</a> 

  formats</p>

<p></p>

<p>To view a dataset using Tabular View, first select a dataset in the &quot;Project 

  Folder&quot; pane and then select the &quot;tabular View&quot; option in the 

  main display pane at the top-right section of the interface. </p>

<p>Depending on the type of dataset selected, the user if offered different functionality</p>

<p><b>Affymetrix</b>: Selecting 'Show Panels' enables users to view a subselection 

  of genes/markers in the current selected dataset. The selection includes those

markers that belong to activated marker panels. Similarly, selecting 'Show Phenotypes' enables users to 

  view a subselection of Microarrays in the selected dataset. These are those Microarrays

that are part of activated phenotype panels. A user can also change signal 

  values in the table. Double clicking on the cell of interest causes the data 

  field to become editable. All changes made this way are included in a new dataset 

  which is created as a child of the currently selected dataset. The child is 

  created when another dataset or project node is selected in the Project Panel 

  component. </p>

<p><b>Genepix</b>: In addition to the 'Show Panels' and 'Show Phenotypes' options 

  similar to above, the user is allowed options to select 'Background' and 'Signal'. 

  Selecting 'Background' causes background values of the two channels to be displayed. 

  Selecting 'Signal' causes the foreground values for the two channels to be displayed. 

  The background and foreground are appropriately color coded to distinguish the 

  two channels. The signal is computed from the foregrounds and backgrounds and 

  as such only the background and foreground values can be edited in a manner 

  similar to above.</p>

<p>Also the columns can be moved around by dragging the Microarray name field 

  to a new position to allow for easy comparisons between microarrays</p>
