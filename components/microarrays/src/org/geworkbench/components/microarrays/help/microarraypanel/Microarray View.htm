    <h3>Microarray View</h3> 
    <p>The Microarray View is located in the<b> View Area</b> in the top right of the application. Measurements in the selected microarray dataset are displayed as spots over a green-red color spectrum in the Microarray View. For datasets comprising more than one microarray, the first microarray data is shown as default, use the slider below the display area to view other microarrays. Missing data is separately color coded (see Missing Values Filter in Filtering tools for additional information).</p>

    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p><b>All Arrays:</b>The checked/ selected <b>All Arrays</b> checkbox indicates the component is displaying the entire set of arrays from the loaded dataset. The user can clear the All Arrays check box to display only arrays in the activated Phenotype Set. The microarrays are displayed in the order in which they where selected in the set. When "All arrays" are shown than the original order is restored.  </p> 
    <p><b>All Markers:</b> The checked/ selected <b>All Markers</b> checkbox indicated the component is displaying the entire set of markers from the data. To include only gene sets that are currently activated, the user clears the checkbox. If cleared, the markers displayed are marker drawn corresponds to markers in the activated Marker sets. The markers are displayed in the order added to the Marker Set. When All Arrays are selected, the original order is restored.  </p> 
    <p><b>Intensity slider:</b> This widget increases or decreases the intensity of the display. </p> 
    <p><b>Array slider:</b> This widget is used to scroll through the Microarrays in the currently selected dataset. The grid is updated with spots representing marker values in the Microarray being displayed. The relative positions of the markers remain the same across all the Microarray grids. The name of the array displayed in the component is listed to the right of the All Markers checkbox.</p> 
    <p><b>Clicking on graph:</b> Clicking on any of the grid cells in the microarray display highlights the marker clicked in the Marker Set.</p> 
    <p><b>Right click on graph:</b> This displays a pop-up menu with the following options:</p> 
    <p>Show marker will highlight the selected marker(s). </p> 
    <p>Remove marker will remove the selected marker and repaint it with original color. </p> 
    <p>Image Snapshot saves the drawn grid image as a child of the currently selected dataset</p>
