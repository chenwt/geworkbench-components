<h3>Expression Profile View</h3>
   <p>The Expression Profile visualization is located in the <b>View Area</b> (see image below) in the top-right of the application. The Expression Profile view makes it possible to visualize changes in the gene expression levels across different hybridizations. This is useful especially in the analysis of time course or dose response experiments. Since the tool generates a graphical representation of relative expression levels across two or more arrays, the Expression Profile view can only be applied to datasets containing multiple arrays. </p> Measurements in the selected microarray dataset are displayed in the graph with corresponding x-y axes coordinates. Each Marker is displayed as a unique colored line. When the mouse is scrolled over a data point on the chart, the tool tip displays a description of the data point.

   <p><b>Basic Usage</b></p>
    <p>A. Expression level</p> A pairwise (array vs. array and marker vs. marker) comparison and plotting of expression values.
    <p>B. The tool tip describes the data point where marker AFFX-BioB-3 in array 71D40L30.CHP has an expression level of 0.0. Clicking on a data point highlights the selected gene in the gene set and the selected array in the phenotype set.</p> 
    <p>&#10170; <b>Right click on the graph:</b> </p> 
    <p>&#12290; <b>Save Image:</b> Stores the image as a child of the currently selected dataset.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; <b>Zoom in/out:</b> The user selects/highlights a region of the graph by left clicking and drag down (zooming in) or upward (zoom out) over a region of the image or selecting right click <b>Zoom In </b>or <b>Zoom Out </b>option.</p> 
    <p>C. Each grid point is a microarray in an activated set or in the dataset. </p> 
    <p>D. <b>Activated Arrays</b>: When selected, the only microarrays displayed are those belonging to activated phenotypic sets. Otherwise, data for all microarrays in the selected set are shown. The number of grid points for each marker profile equals the number of Microarrays in activated Phenotype sets. </p> 
    <p><b>Activated Markers: </b>Selecting this checkbox results in the display of markers that are part of activated marker sets. Otherwise, data from all markers are shown. The marker profiles drawn correspond to markers in the activated Marker sets. </p>
