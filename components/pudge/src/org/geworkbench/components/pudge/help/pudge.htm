<a name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Pudge component serves as a front end to the web-based Pudge
protein structure modeling service developed by the Honig lab at
Columbia University. </p><p>Computational protein structure prediction using sequence
homology is a process the exploits the observation that proteins with
similar sequences usually have similar structures as well. While this
idea is simple in theory, in practice, the process of using sequence
homology to predict protein structure is intricate and complex. The
process is generally divided into five stages, involving the use of a
combination of techniques from a variety of scientific disciplines. See
Petrey &amp; Honig, 2005 for a description of the overall protein
structure prediction process. </p><p><br>

<a name="Parameters_and_running_Pudge"></a><h2>Parameters and running Pudge</h2>
<p>If Pudge has been loaded via the CCM, it will appear in the Analysis
area when a FASTA sequence file is loaded and selected in the Project
Folders area.

</p><p>To run Pudge, 
</p><p>1. add a job name in the Job Name text field.
</p><p>2. optionally, add a PDB protein structure file to serve as a starting structural template.
</p><p>3. click Analyze. This will cause a web browser page to be
displayed which contains a large number of additional configuration
options.

4. Once any changes have been made, click on Go to launch the job.
</p><p>Results will be displayed in a web browser window within
geWorkbench. From there, once can save result files in PDB format and
load them into geWorkbench for viewing and further manipulation.
