    <h3>Sequence Retriever </h3> 
    <p>The Sequence Retriever is located in the top-right of the application. This component retrieves sequences for the active markers listed in the Selected Markers list. Sequences found can be added to project as a sequence dataset and viewed in the Promoter Panel, Sequence Panel and Position Histogram.</p> 
    <p><img width="902" height="414" src="SequenceRetriever_files/image001.gif"></p> 
    <h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
    <p><b>Selected Markers: </b>From this list of markers in active marker panels, the application will obtain sequences in which to search for putative promoters</p> 
    <p><b>Type:</b> Dropdown selection box to indicate DNA or Protein.</p> 
    <p><b>Region: </b> Only valid for retrieving DNA sequence, these text boxes define the length of retrieved sequence. For example, -800 to +800 define regions of 1600bp DNA sequences which starts from upstream 800 bp location.</p> 
    <p><b>Get Sequence: </b>Click on<b>Get Sequence</b>to retrieve sequences. If no sequences are found for the selected markers, a pop-up message indicates that none are found. If no sequences are found, the sequence overview is displayed as lines. Use mouse over to view the location of current spot in the whole retrieved sequence. Sequences can be viewed by double clicking a line and to return to the sequence overview, double click again.</p> 
    <p><b>Add to Project: </b>Click <b>Add to Project</b> to save the sequences as a sequence dataset in the project.</p>
