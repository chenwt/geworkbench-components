    <h3>Sequence Panel</h3> 
    <p>The Sequence Panel is located in the top-right of the application. This component displays results from the Sequence Discovery Component located in the Analysis Area in the lower-right of the application. In this view, each sequence in the selected dataset is displayed as a thin red line proportional to the sequence length. Click on the individual lines to display the sequence details and at the bottom of the Sequence Component. </p>

    <p><b>Navigating a Sequence Panel</b></p> 
    <p>&#12290; Clicking on an individual line displays the sequence detail at the bottom of the Sequence Component. The display of sequence is proportional to the click position in the line. If you click at the beginning of the line, the bottom will show the first part of the sequence. If you click the center place of a line, the bottom will show the middle part of whole sequence. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; Use the right scroll bar to view all sequences. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; Click on &quot;All / Matching Pattern&quot; to display only sequences with the specific pattern.</p> 
    <p><b>Viewing Sequences with Patterns<a name="pattern"></a> </b></p>  
    <p>Use the Pattern Discovery Module to search for Patterns in the <b>Selection Area</b> in the lower-left of the application. The patterns can be viewed by selecting the hit of interest. The pattern will be displayed in the Pattern view, Promoter and the Sequence Component View. Each pattern (row) selection in the result of the Pattern Discovery Module displays a unique color in the Visualization components of Pattern, Promoter and Sequence Component View. </p>
