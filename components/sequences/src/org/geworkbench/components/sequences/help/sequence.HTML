    <h3>Sequence Component </h3> 
    <p>The Sequence Component is located in the top-right of the application. This component displays result from the Sequence Discovery Component located in the Analysis Area in the lower-right of the application. In this view, each sequence in the selected dataset is displayed as a thin red line proportional to the sequence length. Click on the individual lines to display the sequence details and at the bottom of the Sequence Component </p> 
    <p><b>View a Sequence Dataset </b></p> 
    <p>1. <a href="#_To_load_a_sequence_file_into_projec">Load a sequence file into project.</a></p>

    <p><b>Navigating a Sequence Component</b></p> 
    <p>&#12290; Clicking on an individual line at the bottom of the Sequence Component displays the sequence detail. The display of sequence is proportional to the click position in the line. If you click at the beginning of the line, the bottom will show the first part of the sequence. If you click the center place of a line, the bottom will show the middle part of whole sequence. </p>
