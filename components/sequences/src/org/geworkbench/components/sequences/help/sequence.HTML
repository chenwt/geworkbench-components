    <h3>Sequence Component </h3> 
    <p>The Sequence Component is located in the top-right of the application. This component displays result from the Sequence Discovery Component located in the Analysis Area in the lower-right of the application. In this view, each sequence in the selected dataset is displayed as a thin red line proportional to the sequence length. You can click on the individual lines and at the bottom of the Sequence Component, then the sequence details will be shown there. </p> 
    <h3>To view a sequence dataset using Sequence Component:</h3> 
    <p>1. <a href="#_To_load_a_sequence_file_into_projec">Load a sequence file into project</a>. FASTA files have a file extension of .FA<b>.</b></p> 
    <p>2. Select a sequence dataset in the<b> Project Area</b> in the top-left section of the interface.</p> 
    <p>3. Then select the <b>Sequence Component</b> option in the <b>View Area</b> in the top-right section of the interface. <a name="_To_load_a_sequence_file_into_projec"></a></p> 
    <h3>Navigating a Sequence Component</h3> 
    <p>&#12290; If you click on an individual line, the bottom of the Sequence Component displays the sequence detail. The display of sequence is proportional to the click position in the line. If you click at the beginning of the line, the bottom will show the first part of the sequence. If you click the center place of a line, the bottom will show the middle part of whole sequence.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; You can use the right scroll bar to view all sequences.</p>

    <h3>View Sequences with Patterns<a name="pattern"></a> </h3> 
    <p>Use the Pattern Discovery Module to search for Patterns in the <b>Selection Area</b> in the lower-left of the application. The patterns can be viewed by selecting the hit of interest. The pattern will be displayed in the both the Pattern view, Promoter and the Sequence Component View. Each pattern (row) selection in the result of the Pattern Discovery Module displays a unique color in the Visualization components of Pattern, Promoter and Sequence Component View.</p> 
    <p>1. Clicking on pattern hits in the Sequence Component</p> 
    <p>2. If you click on the top button &quot;All / Matching Pattern&quot;, then only sequences with the specific pattern will be shown up.</p>

    <h3> To load a sequence file into project:</h3> 
    <p>1. In the <b>Project Area</b> of the application, right click a project node and select <b>Open File </b>or, from the top menu, File-&gt;Open&gt;File</p> 
    <p>2. Select from the dropdown list <b>Files of Type </b>and select &quot;FASTA Files&quot;</p>
