<h3>Sequence Panel</h3> 
    <p>The Sequence Panel is located in the top-right of the application in the Visualization area. In this view, each sequence in the selected dataset FASTA file dataset is displayed as a thin line proportional to the sequence length in the <b>Line View</b> as well as character strings in the <b>Full Sequence</b> View. This help topic describes <a href="#_Navigating_a_Sequence_Panel">basic navigation</a> and <a href="#_Viewing_Sequences_with_Patterns">viewing sequences</a> with patterns. </p>

    <h3><a name="_Navigating_a_Sequence_Panel"></a>Navigating a Sequence Panel</h3> 
    <p>The steps of basic usage are indicated in the above screenshot. </p> 
    <p>1. View: Select the display format of the sequence data. In the <b>Line View</b>, each sequence is represented by a line proportional to its length, preceded by the sequence ID. The <b>Full Sequence</b> the full character strings are displayed preceded by the sequence ID.</p> 
    <p>2. All / Matching Pattern: Limits the display to sequence with Patterns.</p> 
    <p>3. All Sequence: Limits the display to only sequences that belong to activated groups. </p> 
    <p>4. A user can mouse over a sequence and the numeric position is displayed in a tooltip. Click on the individual lines to display the character string in the sequence details and at the bottom of the Sequence Component. </p> 
    <p>5. Sequence Display: A single click on a line or sequence string, the Sequence Detail will populate with the character strings of the section of the sequence string selected. The display of sequence details is proportional to the click position in the line. If you click at the beginning of the line, the bottom will show the first part of the sequence. If you click the center place of a line, the Sequence display will show the middle part of whole sequence. </p> 
    <p>6. Arrows: Allows for scrolling to view the right/left of character string in the <b>Sequence Display</b> window.</p> 
    <h3><a name="_Viewing_Sequences_with_Patterns"></a>Viewing Sequences with Patterns<a name="pattern"></a> </h3> 
    <p>Use the Pattern Discovery Module to search for Patterns in the <b>Selection Area</b> in the lower-left of the application. The patterns can be viewed by selecting the hit(s) of interest. Each pattern (row) selected in the result of the Pattern Discovery Module is displayed as a unique color block in the Sequence Component View. You can click on a pattern block (in the Line or Full Sequence view) and the location of the pattern match is displayed in the Sequence Displays at bottom of the view with the matching location centered in the view. The tool tip includes the pattern (motif) and the numeric position of the first and the last matching pattern character.</p>
