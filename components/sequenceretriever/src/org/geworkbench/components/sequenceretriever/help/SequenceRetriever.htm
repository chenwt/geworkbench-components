<h2>Sequence Retriever </h2>

<p>The Sequencer Retriever component retrieves nucleotide or protein sequences for selected markers (genes).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nucleotide sequences are obtained from the UC Santa Cruz server. This is genomic sequence and is retrieved relative to the gene transcription start site. The user can enter how many bases up- and down-stream from the start site are to be retrieved. </li>
  <li>Protein sequences are obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) server. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>The major controls in the Sequence Retriever component are:</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> The type of sequence to retrieve, either DNA or Protein. The location from which the sequence will be retrieved is shown on a separate pulldown. </p>
<p><strong>Get Sequence: </strong>Sequences for the selected sequences will be retrieved (if available).</p>
<p><strong>Add to Project:</strong> Retrieved sequences can be add as a new dataset in the Project Folders component. This allows their reuse by other components such as BLAST or Promoter.</p>
<p>Sequence Extent <strong>(- or +)</strong>. For nucleotide sequences, the distance up (-) and downstream (+) of the transcription start site can be specified. </p>
<p><strong>View:</strong> Line or Full Sequence. Switches between a simple line representation and a detailed sequence listing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>The Sequence Retriever component uses marker name to gene name mappings. These are only available if the annotation file for a microarray platfrom was read in at the time that the dataset was loaded. </p>
<p>Before retrieving sequences, a set of markers must be defined and activated in the Markers component:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Retrieving sequences: </h3>
<p>The Sequence Retriever component displays any  marker sets activated in the Markers component:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the type of sequence desired, DNA or Protein. Currently only one source for each sequence type is provided. </p>
<p>To retrieve sequences for the desired markers, click <strong>Get Sequence</strong>. </p>
<p>A pop-up appears showing the available genome assemblies. Confirm that the desired assembly is selected and click OK. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retrieved sequences are displayed. For DNA, the transcription start site is show as the boundary between blue and red segments. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double-click on any of the line representations to see the detailed sequence. Double-clicking again returns you to the line view. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adding sequences to a new dataset: </h3>
<p>In the line view, one can select sequences to be added to a new dataset in the Project Folders component.</p>
<p><img src="SequenceRetriever_files/T_SequenceRetriever_sequence_selection.png" width="288" height="193"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Add to Project</strong> will add them. A popup appears asking for a name for the new dataset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="SequenceRetriever_files/T_SequenceRetriever_sequence_dataset_name.png" width="271" height="120"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the name is entered, the new dataset   appears in the Project Folders component.</p>
