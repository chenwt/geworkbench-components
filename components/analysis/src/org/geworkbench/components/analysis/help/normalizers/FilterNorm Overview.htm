  <h3>Normalizers</h3> 
    <p>The application offers a selection of pluggable normalizers to assist in the manipulation of the data. The Normalizer panel is located in the <b>Commands/ Analysis</b> area in the lower right side of the application.</p> 
    <p>Normalizers are used to perform some needed data transformation, usually in preparation of an analysis step to follow. Normalizing a dataset will not give rise to a new dataset. Normalization results are applied &#8220;in place&#8221;, substituting pre- with post-normalization values. </p> 
    <p><b>Apply a Normalizer</b></p> 
    <p>1 In the Normalization Panel, select the appropriate normalizer from the selection list.</p> 
    <p>2 Enter associated parameters that control the normalization operation. </p> 
    <p>3 Click on <b>Normalize</b>. The View Area is updated to reflect the filter applied (after the screen has been refreshed).</p> 
    <p><b>Note: </b>Normalization is performed directly on the loaded dataset; a separate copy is <u>not generated.</u></p> 
    <p><img width="905" height="282" src="images/Normalization%20panel.gif"></p> 
    <p><b>Save Normalization Settings</b></p> 
    <p>4 Click on <b>Save Settings </b>which will result in a pop up window &#8220;New Parameter Setting Name&#8221;.</p> 
    <p>5 Enter a text description and click on <b>Ok</b>.</p> 
    <p>6 The description will appear in the text box to the right of the Normalizer selection. The Normalization parameters are now saved along with other user settings. Saving these settings does not store a separate copy of the dataset. </p> 
    <p>Some of the normalizers available are the following:</p> 
    <p>n Missing value computation: Replaces every &quot;missing&quot; value with either the mean value of its marker across all microarrays or with the mean measurement of all markers in the microarray where the missing value belongs.</p> 
    <p>n Log transformation: The log2 transformation is applied to all measurements in a microarray. The normalization will not be performed (and an error message will be displayed) if the data set being normalized contains non-positive values.</p> 
    <p>n Threshold value: All data points whose value is less (or more) than a user-specified minimum (maximum) value are raised (reduced) to that minimum (maximum) value.</p> 
    <p>n Marker-based centering: Subtracts the mean (or median) measurement of a marker profile from every measurement in the profile.</p> 
    <p>n Microarray-based centering: Subtracts the mean (or median) measurement of a microarray from every measurement in that microarray.</p> 
    <p>n Mean-variance normalizer: For every marker profile, the mean measurement of the entire profile is subtracted from each measurement in the profile and the resulting value is divided by the profile&#8217;s standard deviation.</p> 
    <p>n Quantile normalizer: Adjusts expression levels so that the expression value distribution of each microarray is identical.</p> 
    <p>Experienced users can add or remove normalizers by manipulating the relative entries in the application configuration file (see the design documentation). </p>
