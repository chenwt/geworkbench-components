<h3>Hierarchical Clustering</h3>

<p>Hierarchical clustering is a method to group markers together based on

similarity on their expression profiles and to organize the grouped markers in a

tree-like hierarchical structure to indicate the strength of their correlations.</p>

<p>The parameters used for this analysis method are:

<ol>

  <li><u><i>Clustering Method</i></u>: This parameter is used to indicate the convention used 

    for determining cluster-to-cluster distances when constructing the hierarchical 

    tree. Available options are:

    <ul>

      <li><b><i>Single Linkage</i></b>: The distances are measured between each member of one 

        cluster each member of the other cluster. The minimum of these distances 

        is considered the cluster-to-cluster distance.</li>

      <li><b><i>Average Linkage</i></b>: The average distance of each member of one cluster 

        to each member of the other cluster is used as a measure of cluster-to-cluster 

        distance.</li>

      <li><b><i>Total Linkage</i></b>: The distances are measured between each member of one 

        cluster each member of the other cluster. The maximum of these distances 

        is considered the cluster-to-cluster distance.</li>                

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><u><i>Clustering Dimension</i></u>: These options are used to indicate whether to cluster 

    markers, microarrays, or both.</li>

  <li><u><i>Distance Metric</i></u>: Euclidean Distance, Pearson Correlation and Spearman Rank 

    Correlation are provided as options. </li>
