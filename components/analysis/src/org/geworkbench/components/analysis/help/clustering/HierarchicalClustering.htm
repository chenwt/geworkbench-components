 <h3>Hierarchical Clustering</h3> 
    <p>Hierarchical clustering is a method to group markers together based on similarity on their expression profiles and to organize the grouped markers in a tree-like hierarchical structure to indicate the strength of their correlations. This help section describes <a href="#_Apply_a_Hierarchical_Clustering Alg">applying Hierarchical Clustering algorithm</a> and <a href="#_Dendrogram_Visualization_1">visualizing the results</a>.</p>

    <p><b><a name="_Apply_a_Hierarchical_Clustering Alg"></a>Apply a Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm</b></p> 
    <p>1 In the Analysis Panel, select Hierarchical Clustering from the selection list.</p> 
    <p>2 Populate the parameters used for this analysis method:</p> 
    <p><i> Clustering Method: </i> This parameter is used to indicate the convention used for determining cluster-to-cluster distances when constructing the hierarchical tree. Available options are: </p> 
    <p><i> Single Linkage:</i> The distances are measured between each member of one cluster each member of the other cluster. The minimum of these distances is considered the cluster-to-cluster distance.</p> 
    <p><i> Average Linkage:</i> The average distance of each member of one cluster to each member of the other cluster is used as a measure of cluster-to-cluster distance.</p> 
    <p><i> Total Linkage:</i> The distances are measured between each member of one cluster each member of the other cluster. The maximum of these distances is considered the cluster-to-cluster distance.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Clustering Dimension: These are used to indicate whether to cluster markers, microarrays, or both.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Distance Metric: Euclidean Distance, Pearson Correlation and Spearman Rank Correlation are provided as options.</p> 
    <p>3 User specifies where to run the analysis in the <b> Service subtab</b>. The Service subtab allows the user to select which compute server to use: Local or Grid. The local instance of the server runs on the user's machine; GRID allows the user to pick up one among the available caGrid-enabled versions of Hierarchical Clustering.</p>
    <p>4 Click <b>Analyze </b>. The Visual Area is updated to reflect the Dendrogram. <a name="_Dendrogram"></a><a name="_Dendrogram_Visualization"></a></p> 
    <p><b> &#12290; Error Message: </b> If missing values are included in the data, a pop up message will state <i> Microarray set contains missing values </i>. To remove the missing values, run the Missing Value Computation Normalization.  This is described in detail in Normalizers Help section. </p>
    <p><b><a name="_Dendrogram_Visualization_1"></a>Dendrogram Visualization</b></p> 
    <p><b><img border="0" width="632" height="378" src="Hierarchical%20Clusteringed_files/image002.gif"></b></p>  
    <p>	<b>Basic Usage</b></p>   
    <p>&#12290;Enable Zoom: When Enable Zoom is selected, areas of interest can be mouse selected in the dendrogram. The selected region is magnified in <b>View Area</b>. To return to the original image, unselect <b>Enable Zoom</b>.</p> 
    <p>&#12290;Gene Height: Modifies (increasing or decreasing) the display of Gene Height.</p> 
    <p>&#12290;Gene Width: Modifies (increasing or decreasing) the display of Gene Width.</p> 
    <p>&#12290;Intensity Slider: Adjusts the dendrogram display intensity. </p> 
    <p>&#12290;Right click > Add to Set: The genes in the selected region is added as a new Cluster Tree Marker Set.</p> 
    <p>&#12290;Right click > Image Snapshot: The Dendrogram is captured as JPEG image and added to the Project Tree.</p> 
    <p>&#12290;Tool Tip (light bulb): When the tool tip is enabled (bright yellow,) moving the mouse pointer over any spot of the Dendrogram displays the chip, marker and signal corresponding to that point. </p>
