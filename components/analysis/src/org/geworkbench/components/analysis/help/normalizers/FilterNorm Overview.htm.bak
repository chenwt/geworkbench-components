<h3>Filters &amp; normalizers</h3>

<p>The application offers a selection of pluggable filters and normalizers to

assist in the manipulation of the data and in their preparation for analysis. </p>



<p>Filters are used in order to remove data points from an expression

dataset, e.g. because some quality data criterion is not met. The result of

applying a filter is (1) either to set the status of a value to

&quot;missing&quot; or, (2) to completely eliminate a marker from the dataset.

In the later case, all measurements for that marker (across all microarrays in

the microarray set being filtered) will be eliminated. </p>



<p>Similar to filters, normalizers modify the dataset on which they are applied.

Instead of eliminating data points, though, a normalizer rather modifies them

(usually in preparation of an analysis step to follow).&nbsp; </p>



<p>Filtering or normalizing a dataset A will give rise to a new dataset B. The

dataset B will appear as a child of A in the project tree window. The selection

of available filters and normalizers are made available from the Filtering and

the Normalization Panels in the application (figure below). Experienced users

can add or remove filters and normalizers by manipulating the relative entries

in the application configuration file (see the design documentation). Most

filters/normalizers have associated parameters that control their operation.

Values for these must be provided using the Filtering/Normalization panels. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">A variety of filters and normalizers are available with the application:</p>

<p class="BulletL1"><b><i>Filters<o:p>

<ul type="circle">

  <li>

    <p class="BulletL2"><i><u>Missing values filter</u></i>: Discards all markers that

have &quot; missing&quot; measurments in at least X microarrays, where X is a user specified

value.<br>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p class="BulletL2"><i><u>Deviation-based filter</u></i>: Sets to &quot;missing&quot; all markers whose

measurement deviation across microarrays is below a given value.<br>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p class="BulletL2"><i><u>Expression threshold filter</u></i>: Sets to

&quot;missing&quot; all markers

whose measurement levels are outside (or inside) a user defined range.<br>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p class="BulletL2"><i><u>Affymetrix detection call filter</u></i>. Applicable to data

from Affymetrix arrays. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Sets

to “missing” all measurements whose detection status is any combinations of

A, P or

M.&nbsp;<br>

    </span></li>

  <li>

    <p class="BulletL2"><i><u>2 channel threshold filter</u></i>. Applicable to 2-channel

arrays (Genepix). Defines applicable ranges for each individual channel. Sets to

&quot;missing&quot; all values for which either channel intensity does not

respect its defined range.</li>

every marker profile, the mean measurement of the entire profile is subtracted
