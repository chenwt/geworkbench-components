    <h3>Self Organizing Map</h3> 
    <p>Self Organizing Map (SOM) is an algorithm to perform clustering of real vectors defined on an instance space of dimensionality. The clusters found are described by prototypical instances, referred as neurons of the SOM, which are arranged topologically in the form of a one or two dimensional grid, the Self Organizing Map. This help section describes the parameters to<a href="#_Basic_Usage_1"> generate an SOM </a> and <a href="#_INSERT_SOM_CLUSTERS_IMAGE">viewing an SOM Cluster</a>. </p>

    <p><b><a name="_Basic_Usage_1"></a>Basic Usage</b> 
    <p>The following parameters are populated to generate a SOM. This component is located in the lower left of the application.</p> 
    <p><b>Rows:</b> The number of rows that the user desires in the resulting SOM. This must be a number greater than 0.</p> 
    <p><b>Columns:</b> The number of columns that the user desires in the resulting SOM. This must be a number greater than 0.</p> 
    <p><b>Radius:</b> When using the bubble neighborhood parameter this float value is used to define the extent of the neighborhood. If an SOM vector is within this distance from the winning node (the cluster to which an element has been assigned) then that Node (and SOM vector) is considered to be in the neighborhood and its SOM vector is adapted. This must be a number greater than 0.</p> 
    <p><b>Iterations:</b> The number of times the dataset will be presented to the Map. Each expression element will be presented this number of times to train the Nodes. This must be a number be greater than 0.</p> 
    <p><b>Alpha: </b>This value is used to scale the change of individual SOM vectors when a new expression vector is associated with a node. This must be a value between 1 and 0.</p> 
    <p><b>Function: </b>The neighborhood options indicate the conventions (formulas) used to update (adapt) an SOM vector once an expression vector has been added into a Node's neighborhood. </p> 
    <p> - Bubble: This option uses the provided radius (see above) to determine which surrounding SOM nodes are in the neighborhood and therefore are candidates for adaptation. When this option is selected the Alpha parameter for scaling the adaptation is used directly as provided from the user. </p> 
    <p> - Gaussian: This option forces all SOM vectors in the network to be adapted regardless of proximity to the winning node. In this case the Alpha parameter is scaled based on the distance between the SOM vector to be adapted and the winning node's SOM vector. </p> 
    <p><b> Service: </b> The Service subtab allows the user to select which compute server to use to run the analysis: Local or Grid. The local instance of the server runs on the user's machine; GRID allows the user to pick up one among the available caGrid-enabled versions of SOM Clustering.</p>
    <p><b> Analyze:</b> Populate the parameters of the analysis and click on Analyze. The results are displayed in the <b>SOM Clusters</b> visualization component.</p>

    <p>Each point in the grid is associated with two set of coordinates. The first one gives the coordinates of the point within the grid, for example in the case of a two dimensional map it is the line and column number in which that neuron is placed. The second one is the set of coordinates of the point in the initial space where the training instances come from. </p> 
    <p>The main property of the self organized maps is that points which are neighboring in the grid i.e. are placed closely in terms of the lines and columns of the grid, are also close in the initial space. We are considering a two dimensional SOM only for ease of visualization.</p> 
    <p><b>Basic Usage</b></p>
    <p> The following tools are used in the SOM Cluster component. 
    <p><b>Show Selected:</b> Select Show Selected and then click on the SOM to view an individual SOM. </p> 
    <p><b>Right Click</b> &gt;<b>Add To Panel: </b> The genes included in the selected SOM are added to a new Cluster Grid gene panel. </p> 
    <p><b>Right Click</b> &gt;<b>Image Snapshot:</b> The project test is updated to include that selected SOM as an image node.</p> 
    <p><b>Right Click</b> &gt;<b>Zoom In/Zoom Out:</b> The display of the selected SOM is magnified(zoom in) or decreased in sizing (zoom out) This can also be performed by left clicking and dragging the mouse downward to zoom in and upwards to zoom out. </p>
