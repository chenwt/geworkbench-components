<h3>Self Organizing Map</h3>

<p>The self organizing map is an algorithm to perform clustering of real vectors

defined on an instance space of dimensionality d. The clusters found are described by prototypical instances,

referred as neurons of the SOM, which are arranged topologically in the form of a one or two dimensional grid,&nbsp;

the Self 

  Organizing Map. Each point in the grid is associated with two set of coordinates.

The first one gives the coordinates of the point within the grid, for example 

  in the case of a two dimensional map it is the line and column number in which

that neuron is placed. The second one is the set of coordinates of the point 

  in the initial space where the training instances come from.&nbsp;</p>

<p> The main property of the self organized maps is that points which are neighboring in the grid,

i.e. are placed closely in terms of the lines and columns of the grid, are also close in the initial space. We are considering a two dimensional SOM only for 

  ease of visualization</p>

<p>The parameters used for this analysis method are:</p>

<p><img src="images/SOMParameters.gif" width="524" height="204"></p>

<ol>

  <li> 

    <u><i>Rows</i></u>: The number of rows that the user desires in the resulting SOM

  </li>

  <li> 

    <u><i>Columns</i></u>: The number of columns that the user desires in the resulting SOM

  </li>

  <li> 

    <u><i> 

    Starting Radius</i></u>: When using the bubble neighborhood parameter this float 

      value is used to define the extent of the neighborhood. If an SOM vector 

      is within this distance from the winning node (the cluster to which an element 

      has been assigned) then that Node (and SOM vector) is considered to be in 

      the neighborhood and it's SOM vector is adapted.

  </li>

  <li> 

      <u><i> 

      Number of Iterations</i></u>: The number of times the dataset will be presented 

      to the Map. Each expression element will be presented this number of times 

      to train the Nodes.

  </li>

  <li> 

      <u><i> 

      Learning Rate</i></u>: This value is used to scale the change of individual SOM 

      vectors when a new expression vector is associated with a node.

  </li>

  <li> 

      <u><i>Function</i></u>: The neighborhood options indicate the conventions 

      (formulas) used to update (adapt) an SOM vector once an expression vector 

      has been added into a Node's neighborhood.

    <ul>

      <li> 

          <b><i>Bubble</i></b>: This option uses the provided radius (see above) to determine 

          which surrounding SOM nodes are in the neighborhood and therefore are 

          candidates for adaptation. When this option is selected the Alpha parameter 

          for scaling the adaptation is used directly as provided from the user.       

      </li>

      <li> 

          <b><i>Gaussian</i></b>: This option forces all SOM vectors in the network to be adapted 

          regardless of proximity to the winning node. In this case the Alpha 

          parameter is scaled based on the distance between the SOM vector to 

          be adapted and the winning node's SOM vector.

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

</ol>
