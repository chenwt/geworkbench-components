<h3>Multi T-Test Analysis</h3> 
    <h3>This analysis performs pair-wise t-tests between multiple groups of phenotypes. The results are multiple-test corrected using Holm test correction. This analysis should be used instead of the regular t-test if you plan to compare multiple groups.</h3> 
    <p><img width="736" height="264" src="MTest/image002.gif"></p> 
    <h3>Apply Multi T-Test </h3> 
    <p>1 From the Analysis Panel, select <b>Multi T</b><b>-Test Analysis </b>from the selection list.</p> 
    <p>2 Update the parameters settings as described in the <a href="#_Parameter">parameter </a>section.</p> 
    <p>3 Click on<b> Analyze. </b>The analysis results:</p> 
    <p>&#12290; The values of the Multi T-Test can be seen in the Volcano Plot and Color Mosaic panels created for each comparison.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; The Project panel is updated to reflect a child data node for each comparison. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; In the Marker Panel, the markers which met the significance test are included in panels for each pair of phenotypes compared.</p> 
    <h3><a name="_Parameter"></a>Parameter Settings</h3> 
    <p>The T Test analysis parameters are as follows:</p> 
    <p>n <a href="#_Critical_P-Value">Critical P-Value</a></p> 
    <p>n <a href="#_Compare_Panels">Compare Panels</a></p> 
    <h3><a name="_P-Value"></a><a name="_Critical_P-Value"></a>Critical P-Value</h3> 
    <p><a name="_Degree_of_Freedom"></a><a name="_Compare_Panels"></a>This is the p-value below which markers will be considered to be significant.</p> 
    <h3>Compare Panels</h3> 
    <h3>Phenotype panels associated with the dataset are displayed in this section. Select the panel checkbox to indicate the panels to include in the analysis. A minimum of two panels are required.</h3> 
    <h3>All Arrays</h3> 
    <h3>This has no effect in this analysis</h3> 
    <h3>All Markers</h3> 
    <h3>This overrides any marker selection in the Marker Panel so that all markers are included in the t-test.</h3> 
    <h2>Volcano Plot</h2> 
    <p>A volcano plot is a scatter plot of fold change (log-2 difference) and significance. Markers that are far from the origin (0, 0) are generally considered to be candidates for further analysis.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>&#167; Plot Header: Lists the two marker panels compared</p> 
    <p>&#167; Y Axis: -log10 significance. Each unit on the y-axis is an order of magnitude more significance, which higher values being more significant.</p> 
    <p>&#167; X axis: A measure of differential expression such as a log-ratio. Note that data should be log-normalized prior to displaying a Volcano Plot.</p> 
    <p>&#167; Tool tip: the marker name, gene symbol and the significance score (p-value).</p> 
    <p>&#167; Right click options:</p> 
    <p>o Zoom: Increase or decreases the screen magnification. </p> 
    <p>o Print: Open the <b>print</b> dialog box to prints the plot displayed.</p> 
    <p>o Save As: Opens the Save As dialog, where you can: save the document as PNG to a local disk or a remote location.</p>
