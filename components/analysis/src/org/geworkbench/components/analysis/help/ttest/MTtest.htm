<h3>Multi T-Test Analysis</h3> 
    <p>This analysis performs pair-wise t-tests between multiple groups of phenotypes. The results are multiple-test corrected using Holm test correction. The Multi T-Test analysis should be used instead of T-Test if you plan to compare multiple groups. This analysis should be used instead of the regular t-test if you plan to compare multiple groups. The values of the Multi T-Test can be seen in the <a href="#_Volcano_Plot">Volcano Plot</a> and Color Mosaic. </p>

    <h3>Apply Multi T-Test </h3> 
    <p>1 From the Analysis tools, select <b>Multi T-Test Analysis </b>from the selection list.</p> 
    <p>2 Update the parameters settings as described in the <a href="#_Parameter">parameter </a>section.</p> 
    <p>3 Click <b> Analyze.</b> The analysis results include the following:</p> 
    <p>&#12290; The values of the Multi T-Test can be seen in the Volcano Plot and Color Mosaic created for each comparison.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; The project panel is updated to reflect a child data node for each comparison. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; In the Marker Set, the markers which met the significance test are included in groups for each pair of phenotypes compared.</p> 
    <h3><a name="_Parameter"></a>Parameter Settings</h3> 
    <p>The T-Test analysis parameters are as follows:</p> 
    <p><b>Critical P-Value</b>: This is the p-value below which markers will be considered to be significant.</p> 
    <p><b>Compare Panels</b>: Array/Phenotype Sets associated with the dataset are displayed in this section. Select the <b>Array/Phenotype Set </b> checkboxs to indicate the sets to include in the analysis. A minimum of <b> two</b> sets are required.</p> 
    <p><b>All Arrays</b>: This has no effect in this analysis.</p> 
    <p><b>All Markers</b>: Overrides any marker selection to display all markers are included in the T-Test.</p> 
  <h2><a name="_Volcano_Plot"></a>Volcano Plot</h2>  
    <p>A volcano plot is a scatter plot of fold change (log-2 difference) and significance. Markers that are far from the origin (0, 0) are generally considered to be candidates for further analysis.</p>

    <p><b> Description </p></b>
    <p>&#12290; Plot Header: Lists the two marker groups compared.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Y Axis: -log10 significance. Each unit on the y-axis is an order of magnitude more significance, which higher values being more significant.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; X Axis: A measure of differential expression such as a log-ratio. Note that data should be log-normalized prior to displaying a Volcano Plot.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Tool tip: The marker name, gene symbol and the significance score (p-value).</p> 
    <p> Right click options:</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Zoom: Increases or decreases screen magnification. </p> 
    <p>&#12290; Print: Opens the <b>print</b> dialog box to print the plot displayed.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Save As: Opens the Save As dialog, where you can: save the document as PNG to a local disk or a remote location.</p>
