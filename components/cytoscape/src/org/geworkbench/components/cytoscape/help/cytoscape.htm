<a name="Cytoscape"></a><h2>Cytoscape</h2>
<p>This tutorial includes new functionality specific to geWorkbench versions 1.7.0 and later.
</p><p>Cytoscape (<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">www.cytoscape.org</a>) is a sophisticated network and
pathway visualization tool that has been incorporated into geWorkbench
as a component. Within geWorkbench, Cytoscape is used to depict
putative interaction networks, for example as created from running
ARACNe or a Cellular Network Knowledgebase query. Both of these tools
return "adjacency matrices", that is, interaction networks, to the
Project folders component. Currently, Cytoscape version 2.4.7 used in
geWorkbench. </p>
<p>Cytoscape has been integrated into geWorkbench in such a way
that it can communicate in both directions with the Markers component.
</p>
<ol><li> Nodes in a Cytoscape network can be selected indivudually or
by drawing a selection box around them. This will result in the
selected nodes being placed into the "Cytoscape selection" set in the
Markers component.
</li><li> A set of markers in the Markers component can be labeled
with the "tag for visualization" property, which will project that set
onto the network depicted in Cytoscape. Those markers in the
intersection of the tagged set and the network display will be
hightlighted in yellow.
</li></ol>
<p>The use of Cytoscape and its interactions with geWorkbench are
described in the following sections. First we will describe the layout
of the Cytoscape graphical interface. The network diagram depicted was
calculated using ARACNe in the <a href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Tutorial_-_ARACNE" class="external text" title="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Tutorial - ARACNE" rel="nofollow">ARACNe tutorial.
</p>
<a name="Layout_of_the_Cytoscape_component"></a><h2>Layout of the Cytoscape component</h2>
<p>The Cytoscape component has 4 main areas:
</p><p><br>
<img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_ARACNE_result.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_ARACNE_result.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_ARACNE_result.png" width="768" height="579">
</p><p><br>
</p>
<ol><li> At upper left is a list of networks that have been loaded into
Cytoscape, showing the network name, and the number of nodes and edges.
in addition, the numbers in parantheses show the numbers of nodes and
edges which have been highlighted (selected) in the network depiction.
</li><li> At upper right is the main network depiction pane. Gene or
protein symbols/names will be depicted if available. However, if for
examle an Affymetrix microarray dataset was read in but no annotation
file was associated with it, then only probeset names would appear.
Nodes which have been selected are depicted in yellow and are returned
to the "Cytoscape selection" set in the Markers component. Edges which
have been selected are depicted in red.
</li><li> At lower left is a navigation tool, which shows the entire
network and a representation (purple rectangle) of where the viewing
pane described above is situated. The purple viewing pane can be moved
by using the mouse to visualize different parts of the network as
desired. This is done by left-clicking with the mouse in the purple
rectangle and moving it.
</li><li> At lower right is a list of selected nodes.
</li></ol>
<a name="Selecting_nodes_in_Cytoscape"></a><h2>Selecting nodes in Cytoscape</h2>
<ul><li> Individual nodes and/or edges can be selected in Cytoscape by clicking on them with the mouse.  
</li><li> To select multiple nodes or edges, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key while making the selection.  
</li><li> Alternatively, a selection box can be drawn around both nodes
and edges by left-clicking in the network diagram and selecting the
desired targets.
</li></ul>
<p>The figure below shows three nodes selected.
</p><p><br>
<img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_select.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_select.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_select.png" width="528" height="316">
</p><p><br>The result from selecting the three nodes above is
transferred to the Cytoscape selection set in the Markers component.
Note that four probesets are hit by the three genes selected, as a gene
may be represented by multiple probesets.
</p><p><br>
<img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_selected_set.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_selected_set.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_selected_set.png" width="224" height="464">
</p><p><br>
If a selection box is drawn on the network with the mouse, both nodes and edges will be selected as shown below:
</p><p><br>

</p><p><br>
</p>
<a name="Set_operations_on_networks"></a><h2>Set operations on networks</h2>
<p>As described in the previous section, multiple gene nodes can be selected by holding down the <b>Shift</b>
key while left-clicking on each desire node in turn. While the multiple
nodes are selected, one can right-click, which will produce a pop-up
menu. This menu allows one to choose the set of genes which are either
the UNION or INTERSECTION of the those connected directly to the
selected nodes.
</p><p><img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_set_operations.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_set_operations.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_set_operations.png" width="337" height="168">
</p><p>The genes selected in this way are returned to the Markers
component in a set called "Cytoscape Selection". For each gene included
in the UNION or INTERSECTION, there may be more than one marker
associated with it. If so, all markers belonging to a particular gene
will be returned to to the Markers component "Cytoscape Selection" set.
</p>
<a name="Projecting_marker_sets_onto_Cytoscape"></a><h2>Projecting marker sets onto Cytoscape</h2>
<p>The diagram below illustrates projecting a set defined in the
Markers component back onto the Cytoscape network diagram. In this
case, the set of transcription factors originally used in the ARACNe
run is labeled with "tag for visualization" by right-clicking on it and
selecting this menu option.
</p><p><br>
<img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_tag_for_vis.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_tag_for_vis.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_tag_for_vis.png" width="249" height="314">
</p><p><br>
Three nodes are highlighted in the diagram.
</p><p><br>
<img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_tagged.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_tagged.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_tagged.png" width="667" height="506">
</p><p><br>Note that a marker can potentially be associated with more
than one gene. If so, when tagged for visualization, each gene
associated with the marker, if present in Cytoscape, would be
highlighted.
</p>
<a name="Altering_the_view_in_Cytoscape"></a><h2>Altering the view in Cytoscape</h2>
<p>The use of the sliding viewpane at lower left to navigate about the
main drawn network has already been mentioned - it can be grabbed and
moved by left-clicking on it with the mouse.
</p><p>There are several more controls arrayed about the lower edge of
the Cytoscape component. These include four magnifying glass icons:
</p>
<ul><li> "minus" - zoom out.
</li><li> "plus" - zoom in.
</li><li> "open" - zoom to display selected region.
</li><li> "1:1" - zoom out to display all of current network.
</li></ul>
<p>In the image below, the view has been zoomed in:
</p><p><img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_zoom_view.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_zoom_view.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_zoom_view.png" width="659" height="537">
</p>
<a name="Network_commands"></a><h2>Network commands</h2>
<p>Right-clicking on a listed network in Cytoscape will bring up a menu with the following choices:
</p><p><img src="cytoscape_files/T_Cytoscape_Network_manipulations.png" alt="Image:T_Cytoscape_Network_manipulations.png" longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:T_Cytoscape_Network_manipulations.png" width="305" height="202">
</p>
<a name="Edit_Network_Title"></a><h3>Edit Network Title</h3>
<p>Edit the title of the network.
</p>
<a name="Create_View"></a><h3>Create View</h3>
<p>Recreate the network graphics.
</p>
<a name="Destroy_View"></a><h3>Destroy View</h3>
<p>Remove the network graphics.
</p>
<a name="Destroy_Network"></a><h3>Destroy Network</h3>
<p>Completely remove the network from Cytoscape. Note that this does
not remove the netowrk adjacency matrix from the geWorkbench Project
Folders component. The network can be recreated in Cytoscape by
clicking on the appropriate adjacency matrix in the Project Folders
component.
