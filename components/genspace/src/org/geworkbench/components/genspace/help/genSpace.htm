<a name="Introduction_to_genSpace"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction_to_genSpace">Introduction to genSpace</span></h2>
<p>genSpace is a research project at the Programming Systems Laboratory 
at Columbia University which aims to experiment in building 
social-networking oriented collaboration features into the existing 
geWorkbench application. Currently, genSpaceâ€™s primary function is 
identifying workflow patterns and providing real-time suggestions and 
support. genSpace provides researchers with real-time workflow 
suggestions (suggesting possible "next steps" for analysis based upon 
previous histories). genSpace also logs activity within geWorkbench in 
order to provide developers with usage feedback, and users with 
suggestions.
</p><p>genSpace records geWorkbench analysis, filtering and normalization events.
</p>
<a name="Registering_for_an_account_and_logging_in"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Registering_for_an_account_and_logging_in">Registering for an account and logging in</span></h2>
<p>You do not need to register for a genSpace account in order to take 
advantage of most of its features, but it is suggested. To register for 
an account, select "genSpace" from the "Tools" menu in geWorkbench. 
Click "Register." You must at minimum supply a user id, password, and 
your lab affiliation. You may choose to also create a profile with your 
contact information. When you finish entering your information, click 
"Save" to create your profile, and then log in with your newly chosen 
username and password.
</p>
<a name="Setting_your_data_privacy_options"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_your_data_privacy_options">Setting your data privacy options</span></h2>
<p>genSpace logs your analysis events (what kinds of analyses are 
performed and with what settings and how long they take). It does not 
log anything about the data that you process, or what the results are. 
This data is used to provide workflow suggestions to users (ex, try 
using tool B after tool A) and to provide developers with feedback on 
how their tools are used. By default, genSpace logs your activity 
anonymously - not connecting your usage with your username. You can also
 choose to log your events with your username, or disable logging 
completely. To change your privacy settings, log into genSpace, and 
click the "data visibility" tab under "genSpace Login."
</p>
<a name="Defining_Workflows"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Defining_Workflows">Defining Workflows</span></h2>
<p>genSpace receives events at the beginning of an analysis, filtering, 
or normalization event.  However, it does not receive notification of 
when an analysis finishes.  For this reason, only events occurring 
within an arbitrary window of 10 minutes will be grouped into a 
workflow.  Workflows may thus be broken if an analysis runs more than 
ten minutes, or if another step is not carried out in that time.
</p>
<a name="Viewing_common_workflows"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Viewing_common_workflows">Viewing common workflows</span></h2>
<p>To see visualizations of workflows that have been recorded by 
genSpace, choose "genSpace" from the geWorkbench "Tools" menu. Then 
choose the "Workflow Visualization" tab.
</p><p>At most 150 workflows will be displayed.
</p>
<a name="Most_Common_Workflows"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Most_Common_Workflows">Most Common Workflows</span></h3>
<p>You can see the most common workflows conducted by other genSpace 
users by choosing "Most common workflows starting with" or "Most common 
workflows including" from the "select action" drop-down list. Then 
select the analysis tool that you are interested in and click the 
"Search" button.  These two workflow options always are depicted as a 
linear sequence of steps.
</p>
<a name="All_Workflows"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="All_Workflows">All Workflows</span></h3>
<p>You can see all workflows including a particular analysis tool by 
choosing "All workflows including" from the "select action" drop-down 
list and the analysis tool you are interested in from the "select tool" 
drop-down list. Then click the "Search" button.
</p><p>To conserve space on screen, under this option, workflows may include loops if a step is repeated.
</p><p>The visualization will show you the number of workflows found 
(indicated next to the "Search" button. The analysis tool you suggested 
will appear highlighted in yellow.

from the geWorkbench "Tools" menu. Then choose the "Real Time Workflow 
Suggestion" tab.
</p>
<a name="Current_Workflow"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Current_Workflow">Current Workflow</span></h3>
<p>genSpace will show you the analysis tools that you have used in the 
current workflow, as well as the time at which each was started. It will
 also show you how many times the particular workflow has been used by 
other genSpace users, and the most common "superflows" that include that
 workflow.
</p><p>Under "possible next steps", genSpace will suggest other analysis
 tools that have been used in workflows that start with the one you are 
currently performing.
