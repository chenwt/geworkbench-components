  <h2><b>genSpace Overview</b></h2>
    <p>
    genSpace is a tool that allows geWorkbench users to collaborate and share knowledge using a social networking
    metaphor. It transparently logs information about the analysis tools that geWorkbench users run, so as to
    answer such questions as "what are the most commonly used analysis tools?" or "which analysis tools are most
    commonly used together?" These questions are answered by graphical visualizations and by real-time suggestions
    that are integrated into the geWorkbench environment.
 	<p>
    genSpace also incorporates an online wiki that provides registered users with the ability to comment on and
    rate different analysis tools and series of analysis tools, called "workflows".
