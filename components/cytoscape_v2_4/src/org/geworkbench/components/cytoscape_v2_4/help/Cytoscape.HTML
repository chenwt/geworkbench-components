    <h3>Cytoscape</h3> 
    <p>Cytoscape is a software tool for the visualization of molecular interaction networks that has been adapted to work as a component of geWorkbench. This component is located in the <b>Visual Area</b> in the upper right of the application. It&#8217;s typically used to visualize gene regulatory networks reconstructed using the methodology described in &quot;<em><b>ARACNE</b></em><em>: An algorithm for the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks in a mammalian cellular context</em>&quot;, Califano et. al, (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.MN/0410037">http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.MN/0410037</a>). Aracne uses Mutual Information, an information theoretical measure, to compute the correlation between pairs of genes and infer a best-fit network of probable interactions. The resulting network of genes can then be <a href="#_Visualize_a_gene_regulatory network">visualized</a> and<a href="#_Creating_a_Gene_panel on the Cytosc"> modified</a> in the Cytoscape panel. A full description of the capabilities and functionality of Cytoscape can be found at <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">http://www.cytoscape.org/</a>.</p>

    <h3>Visualize a gene regulatory network</p> 
    <p> - Create and load a network.   One example of a method to create a network using the geWorkbench is the Reverse Engineering component. This functionality is described in the User Manual and the Reverse Engineering section of online help.</h3> 
    <p>Note: The &#8220;Layout&#8221; menu item at the top of the Cytoscape panel reveals a large selection of options that can be used to re-orient the network-image. For example the network image below was generated by choosing the Layout&gt; yFiles&gt; organic.</p> 
    <h3><a name="_Creating_a_Gene_panel on the Cytosc"></a>Creating a marker panel on the Cytoscape graph</h3> 
    <p>1 Mouse select the section of interest on the graph or from the file menu Select&gt; and the selection option desired. The selected nodes are highlighted yellow.</p> 
    <p>&#12290; Multiple markers can be selected by holding down the Control key and clicking on the corresponding network nodes; or, by using the mouse to define on the graph a rectangular area containing several markers.</p> 
    <p>2 In the marker panel (in the Selection<b> Area</b> in the lower left), a Selected Genes panel is updated to reflect the number of genes selected.</p> 
    <p>The contents of the panel are dynamically updated as markers within the Cytoscape graph are selected/de-selected. A full description of the capabilities and functionality of Cytoscape can be found at <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">http://www.cytoscape.org/</a>.</p>
